## Open Yourself to Another

The first method of erasing interpersonal barriers consists in opening up and telling about yourself. Usually this helps another person do the same, thereby bringing relationships to a new level of trust. However, opening up sometimes means exposing your doubts and weaknesses. The first step is associated with risk, but this risk is justified. We always want to show ourselves from the best side, make an impression of a successful person. We usually hide our problems and failures. But everyone else does the same. Throwing dust in people's eyes, we make others envious and provoke competition that kills sincerity in relationships. A drop of imperfection and vulnerability won't hurt you at all; on the contrary, it will help remove the barriers separating you. There's no point in somehow surpassing the other party. Your goal isn't to impress but, above all, to attract!

Deep relationships necessarily mean openness in those areas most important to each person—family, health, money, and children. If your interaction includes communication with family members, discussion of hobbies, health and financial issues, debates about the best ways to educate children, then know: you're on the right path to mutual trust. Therefore, as soon as you feel stability in the relationship, take initiative and transfer part of your communication to the above-mentioned topics.

A good way to assess progress in building trusting relationships is to find out whether your connections are capable of talking about their weaknesses and failures. We—like everyone else—have such "goods" in abundance. When the right moment comes, try to do this first and see if the person reciprocates. Joint problem-solving significantly deepens relationships. At the same time, this gives you the opportunity to help, and if such help is accepted, then to address a similar request yourself later.

## Expand the Sphere of Interaction

Discussing the question of how to strengthen new relationships, we emphasized that a very positive factor might be including new connections in your social environment, membership in the same professional organization, or living in the same neighborhood. Common acquaintances and identical impressions—in short, seeing the world from the same point of view—create a sense of belonging and camaraderie. However, to develop stronger relationships, you can't always move to another place or change professions. Fortunately, there are other things that can be done to achieve this goal.

You can include your spouse or girlfriend in these relationships—or even your children. Even if your acquaintance is single, interaction with you in a new, broader context will certainly be beneficial. You'll see your contact in a new setting and in a somewhat different light, as if provoking them to new interactions. This will allow you to reveal sides of their personality hidden by the social roles you both took on in previous meetings. For example, observing a person at meetings and on business trips won't help you understand what kind of husband or father they are. Additionally, your spouse or partner will provide you with a fresh pair of eyes, noticing things you might miss.

For spies, a second pair of eyes is an invaluable opportunity to assess the true level of closeness and sincerity in relationships. Introducing your contact to a new person from your inner circle will allow the other to ask questions or raise the same topics from a different angle.

Let's recall a story that happened during our work in the United States. One of us met a financial consultant of Chinese origin. He worked at a technology firm that was of interest to us. For us, this person could become a good source of information, so a decision was made to try to establish closer relations with him. However, for a long time the relationship remained quite cold and formal. All attempts to move conversations beyond business topics were ignored. Given his Chinese origin, we suspected that building a stronger connection would require more time. However, the absence of any progress overall was alarming.

As a last chance, we invited him and his wife to dinner. This was an excellent opportunity for both of us to look at the couple in a relaxed setting and try to better understand the situation. After several drinks and an informal conversation between the women in the kitchen, it became clear that in this Chinese family it was the wife who played the main role. The husband expected his wife's approval in almost everything. We decided that to strengthen the relationship between the men, it was necessary to strengthen the connection between their female "halves." The next several months were spent establishing contact with his wife, gradually bringing both families closer. It's clear that without a pair of attentive female eyes and teamwork, deep relationships with this person wouldn't have worked out.

When you include a new person in your circle of friends, you indirectly tie them to yourself. They'll establish connections with people who like you and trust you. Each of them will project your positive image onto the newcomer, strengthening their desire to trust you and be closer. From this moment, breaking with you will mean, in essence, breaking relationships with the entire group. And don't forget: each person from your circle becomes a source of additional information about the new contact.

## Provide Help and Support

One of the most valuable "currencies" in relationships is encouragement and support. We always experience a deficit of kind words and understanding: after almost forty years of marriage, we still reproach each other for not receiving this in sufficient quantity. A compliment is a powerful "drug" for building relationships: people yearn to hear something pleasant about themselves. But a compliment should under no circumstances turn into flattery.

Mutual assistance is a good building "brick" of trust. If you know that your friend or colleague has a problem and might need help, don't hesitate to offer it. In the worst case, your offer will be politely declined. But the very fact will certainly be remembered!

Working in intelligence, we discovered an interesting paradox. Many believe that asking for help will necessarily harm relationships, that in such a situation you look weak and dependent. People don't like to appear weak and dependent, fear provoking bewilderment and rejection from the other party. In reality, everything is exactly the opposite. When you, demonstrating some vulnerability, ask for help, you place the person in a position where they can demonstrate strength and capabilities, thereby raising their status in their own eyes. However, there's one nuance. You can safely ask only for what your acquaintance can do without great effort. This is especially true in the early stages of relationships, when connections are still weak and can be easily broken by any misunderstanding. When people ask for and offer help to each other, their relationships become closer. Nothing surprising, because each of you begins to participate more actively in each other's lives.

As soon as you're offered help, you become a kind of debtor. This will give you the opportunity to thank the person with some surplus. They might tell you later: "Oh, you shouldn't have!" but at the same time will be glad that, on one hand, you didn't forget their kindness, and on the other, that they even extracted some benefit from it. From now on you'll be considered a reliable, honest, and pleasant person. Hence the rule when asking for help, which will serve as an effective tool for building connections: ask for little, but thank generously.

We suggest you assess your qualities, experience, and connections and compile a list—a kind of "catalog" of what you're ready to share. The catalog might include professionals you can recommend to other people, for example your friend who's a chiropractor. Do you like running, are you into ornithology or origami? Share your skills and passion with someone. Even if this doesn't "hook" anyone, you'll make an impression as an interesting person and might be recommended to other people. Therefore, don't be afraid to give more than you receive. If you set yourself the goal of making others happier and more successful, don't doubt: they'll respond in kind.

## Organize Lunches and Parties

An interesting fact: most substantive conversations happen precisely at the table. If you need to quickly discuss something, we say: "Let's go have coffee." A serious business issue will certainly require a "business lunch"! To thank someone for a service, we suggest a joint dinner. In a relaxed atmosphere (often having drunk plenty of alcohol) you push your partners to open up and become closer.

That's why you as a networker extremely need to develop the skills of a party and dinner organizer. Not all of us are born conversationalists and "party people." At the beginning of our career, we weren't either. Mastery comes with experience. However, there's always a way out. At first, invite a talkative friend who'll take on the role of a kind of "toastmaster."

When deciding whether to go to a party or come up with some excuse, the main question, as always, sounds the same: who else will be there? The success of an event depends on the optimal combination of its participants. The rules here are quite simple. First, it's desirable that most people know and like each other. This will create excitement and necessary "warm-up." Second, a reasonable balance of men and women, married and single, locals and visitors is necessary—so that no one gets bored. The third rule: you can invite several new faces, but no more than a quarter of the total. This ratio will bring fresh dynamics to communication but at the same time help avoid awkward pauses. And fourth, it's desirable to acquire some "star guest"—an interesting storyteller, a person of high status, or simply invite a friend who just returned from a trip to Tibet...

## Create a Positive Atmosphere

Necessary prerequisites for good relationships are your positivity, openness, and confidence. The task is simple—create a light, positive atmosphere. People should enjoy being in your company. Any negativity or criticism immediately lowers the "temperature" of your interaction.

Praise and a compliment to the person with whom you're building a relationship is one of the surest ways to create positive feelings in them toward you. We know perfectly well how effectively flattery exploits the brain's need for positive "reinforcement." However, a spy must act very carefully in this territory. Spies are fixated on working with smart people, and a smart person will recognize insincere flattery even if deep down they like it. As soon as you're caught using such crude tools, the level of trust in your relationships will fall. For praise to be effective, you need to know real achievements, positive character traits, or a person's actions. The same applies to compliments, whether about a beautiful tie or fresh appearance after vacation.

Above all, you must be sincere and truthful. Don't pretend nothing happened if, for example, you got into an accident on the way to a meeting. Simply explain and reschedule for another time. You might even get a bonus in the form of sympathy and an offer of help, which in itself is one of the "bricks" of relationships.

## Help Others Open Up

The atmosphere in which relationships form depends on how well convergence happens on an emotional level. This can't be achieved if people aren't made to talk. And conversely: when your friend starts talking, they share their emotions. In such cases, you as if become part of them. Remember that as an active listener, you yourself are the driving force of conversation.

You can direct the topic of conversation in the right direction, but on condition that your gestures and posture also express genuine interest. With the right questions, you can shift the focus of conversation so that the person doesn't feel they're being led in some particular direction. For her or him, the course of conversation will seem quite natural. Leading conversation through questions is like redirecting water flow: either by laying channels or building dams.

Moving conversation from one topic to another, you get more chances to obtain information about your partner than if you asked about it directly. Direct questions, especially arising outside the context of conversation, will most likely be ignored or rejected. Hence the advice: train yourself not to ask direct questions at all and not to ask so-called "closed questions"—that is, those that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." Open questions should begin with phrases like "How do you feel about...", giving the person the opportunity to formulate the answer as they wish, without setting any boundaries for reflection. By providing such freedom to the speaker, you can learn more about their interests and motivation.

## Do Something Interesting Together

As soon as you understand someone's priorities and interests, you can use one of the most effective relationship-building tools—spending time together—doing what you both enjoy. Nothing opens another person to you like, for example, a joint trip and new impressions. Moreover, you don't need to watch the latest Hollywood film about buddy cops to understand this. We already know that the most heartfelt conversations happen while fishing or during soccer matches with our children participating.

Several years ago, an acquaintance called me and suggested going fishing. Fishing, honestly speaking, isn't my element, and our relationship wasn't that close. Moreover, I suspected that by calling me out of the blue after several months of silence, this person was counting on some favor. In general, at first I wanted to refuse, but not having better plans for the weekend, I still agreed, hoping to distract myself from the summer city heat in nature. By the time we got to the fishing spot, the weather had deteriorated: it became overcast, strong wind blew. And by evening thunder crashed and rain fell. In short, the fishing didn't work out. In the evening, when the rain stopped, we were soaked through and built a fire to dry our clothes. To warm up better, we uncorked a bottle of whiskey, and spent the next several hours in conversation—first about our misadventures with the weather, then about almost everything—about our lives, family problems, children. Was this the best outing in my life? Of course not. But it turned out definitely unforgettable. And new impressions and shared experience in one fell swoop strengthened our relationship in one leap.

## How to Prepare Productive Meetings

A spy's task isn't just to build relationships but to build them quickly and efficiently. That's why a spy must get maximum from any interaction. Every meeting conducted by an operative worker must be carefully, sometimes down to the smallest details, planned and prepared. Therefore, if you want to achieve better results in communicating with people, you can use the same approach that representatives of our profession use.

At each meeting you pursue two goals simultaneously—advancing the relationship and deepening your understanding of the partner. In reality, relationship development and improvement of mutual understanding are merely two sides of the same coin that mutually reinforce each other. Preparing for a meeting, you must determine for yourself exactly how you'll achieve both of the set goals.

Developing productive exchanges is the best way to strengthen connections. Such a "give and take" process happens between people constantly, consciously or unconsciously. By making exchanges more thoughtful and purposeful, you can significantly improve relationships. That's why before each meeting, think through what you can offer and what you can ask for.

Finally, you need to plan subsequent steps in relationships. After all, you want your future meetings to proceed under better conditions—and with better results!

To help with meeting planning, we offer a fairly simple table that we ourselves used in our work with agents. Filling out the table at first glance may seem tedious or even difficult, but such preparatory work will force you to think purposefully about the upcoming conversation and seek non-trivial solutions. This is a kind of training in mental discipline that guarantees your time won't be wasted. Once you get used to planning meetings in advance, you yourself will feel awkward going to them unprepared. But perhaps the most important thing is different: your preparedness for conversation will be appreciated and rewarded by your counterparties, who also value their time!
