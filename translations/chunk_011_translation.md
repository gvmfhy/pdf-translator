*[Continued from Chunk 10]*

The search for additional "bridges," being a priority at the initial stage, in no way prevents you from using for your own interests other people you encounter within the organization. The basic principles of network development, such as searching for "connectors," "capacitors," and "conductors," remain in force. As "conductors" in this case, you can consider those who can bring you to specific company departments—the procurement department, research and development department, or company divisions in other cities.

Not all employees of an organization are equally important for achieving set goals. Your ultimate goal: reach those who influence the decisions you need. After initial contacts are secured and your presence in the company is ensured, your next step is identifying centers of real power and searching for influential figures. These aren't necessarily those at the top of the organizational structure. Moreover, often direct contact with the highest decision-makers can lead to problems. You'll most likely become the object of attacks from all those who are also fighting for their time and attention.

What criteria can be used to search for people needed to strengthen your influence in an organization? Such people should:

• exert unambiguous influence on decision-making in the organization;
• be "insiders" directly connected with the main power groups;
• have potential for further growth in the organization;
• be ready to develop close personal relationships with you.

The last point is extremely important: if a person is incompatible with you by character, if they don't like you, if they don't listen to your advice, all you can do, despite the power this person possesses, is use them as an occasional source of information.

In searching for influential figures, you should in every way cultivate "capacitors" who can perform the role of your personal "guides." Such people keep in memory the entire chronology of the organization's development. They remember who made successful and unsuccessful decisions, who implemented prestigious or failed projects, who played on whose side and why exactly these people ended up in top management positions. The more such "guides" you have, the better you understand what's really happening and where everything is moving.

Once you understand how everything really works, you'll have a chance to yourself become an intermediary for transmitting information within the company and an influencer. I once met several managers working with large corporate clients who served as reliable conductors of information and new ideas in their client organizations. They claimed to know these client organizations even better than the clients themselves. Don't be surprised: in companies there are often many internal communication barriers and taboos that can only be violated by outsiders. As soon as organization employees see you as a channel for transmitting important messages within the company or up to its management, you can say that now you've truly achieved your goal and become an insider.

From our experience working in an international business consulting firm that served as "cover" for intelligence activities, we can recall several "working group" sessions designed to help transnational semiconductor companies increase chip sales to major smartphone manufacturers. For these projects, both sides gathered global teams that included representatives from research and development departments, logistics chains, manufacturing, and other business units working on launching new products. Observing the interaction of the team leader from the seller's side—an international client manager of the semiconductor company, a cheerful and good-natured Italian—it was impossible to understand whose side he was on—seller or buyer. During negotiations, he sat on the client's side. In the course of exchanging opinions with client employees, he discussed details of product development programs about which, judging by their surprised reaction, even prominent members of the client team had no idea. Moreover, this client manager later admitted that the client company's management regularly turned to him for help in finding new employees...

## Decision-Making Styles

Perhaps you want the organization to make certain decisions favorable to you and your business. However, possible strategies for building contacts and strengthening your own influence will strongly depend on the decision-making style in the organization.

Decision-making styles depend on the balance of power in the organization and on the influence of various groups on the process of appointing managers or selecting suppliers. Some sectors of the company may fall under the influence of various competing stakeholder groups. For example, one group may de facto block some strategic decisions through their key appointee who occupies the position of vice president of finance. Similarly, groups can control each other by appointing their employees to important governing bodies such as, for example, the procurement committee.

Despite various mechanisms of power and regardless of management level, methods of decision-making in organizations, as a rule, fall under three styles. The first assumes the presence of a main decision-maker, sometimes even a monopolist on decision-making—a "tsar." For victory, it's usually enough to convince such a "tsar" to personally support (lobby for) a decision favorable to you. Obviously, in this case your organizational strategy should be aimed at reaching the key figure and influencing them.

The second style is when a decision is made by a committee consisting of representatives of various functions and very often competing power groups. Having convinced one or several members of such a committee, even the most high-ranking and influential, you'll hardly achieve anything if some members oppose your proposal. Here, unlike the case with the "tsar," your calculation isn't to attract active supporters but rather not to make enemies. To achieve this goal, all committee members must view you as independent and impartial, not connected with any of the competitors.

The third style—"bureaucratic"—refers to the case when there's actually no single clear decision-making instance, whether "king" or "committee." The decision becomes the result of a lengthy bureaucratic process when any proposal is considered in stages according to various criteria, that is, practically no one takes personal responsibility for the decision as a whole. Such a nightmarish scenario is increasingly observed in large companies and government organizations, requiring enormous expenditures of time, effort, and nerves from all parties. From a networking point of view, this is the most difficult case, since it requires deep knowledge of the organization in terms of both processes and personalities on the path of decision-making. It's no surprise that only a few "privileged" suppliers can assemble a rich library of personal contacts and experience working with the organization to continue successfully conducting business in such a business environment.

For example, when it comes to government or military procurement in the United States, there are now extremely few contractors who can figure out—not to mention then comply with!—the details of tender documents that list all Congressional requirements. Thus, the only chance for an average company to get a piece of the tasty "pie" is to become a subcontractor to such giants as Boeing or Booz Allen Hamilton, who take a fat margin from contractors and maintain control over clients. And where does Boeing know how to satisfy its clients' requests? Very simply: by hiring former generals—Pentagon insiders!

## How to Take a Place in the Leader's Mind

Now it's time to discuss another important skill of a good networker—understanding the mindset and needs of the decision-maker you need and using appropriate vocabulary. In other words, it's necessary to be on the same wavelength, speak the same language, and see the world through the eyes of the decision-maker.

In our personal experience, chances for establishing relationships will inevitably dry up if you misinterpret the mentality and needs of decision-makers, don't fit into their priorities, and, accordingly, incorrectly explain what you want from them. The reasons are simple: decision-makers are endlessly attacked by flows of people seeking their attention, and they don't want to waste their time. To somehow survive under the influx of affairs and visitors, they've learned to treat all incoming requests like tennis balls—that is, automatically delegate as many such issues as possible to other people, leaving for themselves only those few that interest them personally. Such interest arises when information that lands on their desk can potentially bring them personal benefit—of material, career, or other order.

In business, this looks roughly like this. Imagine you're a sales manager at an IT integrator. And now, finally, you've been appointed a meeting with the head of the international logistics department of a large corporation. How would you position yourself to build productive relationships?

You might talk about updating the system that manages inventory. In this case, there's a high probability that your object will "toss the ball" to their subordinate—the director of the information technology department. You might also propose conducting a detailed audit of corporate IT systems with the goal of implementing best practices. Hearing such a proposal, your potential partner will most likely redirect the "ball" to a higher level in their organization, responding that the question should be addressed to the corporation's chief operating officer. In both cases, your chance of returning to conversation with the head of the international logistics department and establishing direct working relationships with them becomes negligible.

To remain at the level of the decision-maker with whom you want to develop relationships, and so you won't be "kicked" up or down, you need to understand how to become useful for solving specific problems faced by this manager. This is unlikely to happen without the participation of corporate insiders. Imagine such a situation: you learned that the head of the international logistics department is waging a battle against the company's regional branches, which have long wanted the opportunity to independently choose information technology suppliers. In such a situation, a timely proposal to implement new security functions throughout the organization will help your object in the fight against rivals, giving them good arguments for preserving their control over branch decisions. And at the same time will ensure you a place as a valuable ally and even friend.

## Tuning Channels of Influence

We hope your plans related to this or that organization aren't limited only to pressing problems. There's no point spending months and especially years of your precious time on developing relationships if you don't have long-term plans for influencing future corporate decisions. But if such plans exist, then you'll have to build special relationships with two types of people in the organization.

The first type is "visionaries" who determine the company's future. Usually they can be found among such people as the chief technology officer, head of the marketing department, or manager of new products. Each in their own capacity and all together they determine where the organization will move.

The other type is "rising stars." These are people who will most likely be in power tomorrow but are still accessible today. They're not yet surrounded by a "cordon sanitaire" of deputies and assistants and haven't yet become a target for their ill-wishers. Dynamic and ambitious, these people, as our own experience shows, are usually quite open to new ideas, opportunities, and contacts.

There's another feature common to both types that may be useful for you. Both "visionaries" and "rising stars" are very mobile and always seek opportunities for business development and advancing their own careers. Having competitors and enemies within the enterprise and often communicating with headhunters, they prefer to lead any interaction with outsiders away from their own offices. They're more likely than others to participate in conferences and educational business programs where you can get the opportunity to cross paths with them and establish contact in a calmer setting.

One example of the most successful investments in recent years is Yahoo's decision to invest in the young Chinese e-commerce platform Alibaba. To a significant degree, this success became possible thanks to the ability of Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang to identify "rising stars." Jerry Yang himself was born in Taiwan but at the age of ten immigrated to the United States with his family. Having received an education at Stanford University, he founded an internet business that later under the name Yahoo became one of the most successful internet portals.

Three years after founding his business, Jerry made his first trip to mainland China. Upon arrival, he was met by Jack Ma, at that time a junior employee of the Chinese Ministry of Economics. They became close during one of the mountain hikes where they enthusiastically discussed the potential possibilities of the internet. Inspired, Jack Ma founded Alibaba, hoping to bring Chinese companies to the world stage through the internet.

In 2005, Jerry and Jack met again at a summit of leaders from China and Silicon Valley. Alibaba had begun gaining momentum in China but still remained an outsider in the world market. Perceptive Jerry, correctly assessing Jack Ma's potential, during a short walk on the beach negotiated investments in the then-unprofitable Alibaba. This deal subsequently proved fateful. Yahoo's investment in Alibaba paid off handsomely (40 times over!), which only emphasizes Jerry Yang's amazing mastery in identifying talented partners.

## Four Problems in Working with Organizations

Working with organizations, you'll most likely encounter four typical problems. The first is managing your priorities and time. If you don't focus with laser precision on what's most important, you'll be drawn into the company's internal squabbles or get stuck in relationships with courteous and pleasant but at the same time powerless people, ultimately not achieving desired results. You'll have to make difficult decisions about how much time and with whom you spend it and which relationships need to be "frozen." And here your contact network map of the given organization will again help you stay on track.

The second difficulty arises when you suddenly lose important supporters within the company. People don't remain forever in the same positions. They relocate, they have conflicts with others, they're fired... And they won't warn you about this. As a result, you lose access, lose sources of information. Your time and efforts are wasted. That's why you can never rely on one single person. Developing an entire network of supporters must become your constant concern.

One of us lost access to a large organization in France when its first vice president—an active supporter and good friend—came into conflict with a major shareholder of the company who, after many years as a passive investor, decided to take management into their own hands. We worked with this organization for many years, but despite the long history of relationships, all doors for us closed overnight. Could we have foreseen such an unexpected turn of events? As strategists in networking, probably could have. And if we'd followed the simple rule not to close around one person, we wouldn't have encountered such a problem.

The third difficulty consists in overcoming dependence and jealousy. People, especially those who brought you in and helped in the early stages, want to control your advancement within the company: to know whom you're meeting with, what new things you're learning. When you need to move further, expanding your influence and building other relationships at higher levels, your past helpers may begin to envy you, and if you don't find the right approach to them, they'll throw sticks in your wheels. Managing such relationships is a delicate matter requiring great tact and, unfortunately, time. The least you can do to minimize the above-mentioned envy is to pave your path in the enterprise so that your initial "guides" themselves bring you to new contacts.

In the unfortunate case described above with the first vice president, when all "eggs," as they say, were placed in one basket, not one but two whole mistakes were made. Why didn't other top managers in the organization come to help, despite the fact that they were quite satisfied with the joint work? Because they envied the consultant's "exclusive" relationships with their former boss. Was enough work done to strengthen relationships with not one but several managers? Clearly not enough...

The fourth problem arises if you find yourself drawn into a power struggle in the organization in which or with which you work. Attracting outside experts—consultants, lawyers, supplier representatives—as tools for achieving personal goals is common practice among managers fighting for power. Such "mercenaries," or rather...
