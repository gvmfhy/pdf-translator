rather, "cannon fodder," are expected not to be needed after the task is solved. There are even cases when warring parties hire a "temporary" boss to implement a policy that might damage their own reputation. Thus Carlos Ghosn, a Frenchman of Lebanese-Brazilian origin who became famous as the executive director of the Renault concern, was hired by the owners of Japanese Nissan to lead a painful restructuring of the company that no Japanese would undertake. And as soon as the job was done, the real "bosses" of Japanese business standing behind Nissan—one of the symbols of Japanese industry—shamelessly got rid of him. Hence an important lesson: never take anyone's side in internal power battles in an organization, even if you think you're on the winning side. It may seem you've won, but still it's possible you'll need cooperation from many of those who lost now and who, undoubtedly, can later greatly darken your life. This strategic mistake almost cost Carlos Ghosn many years in a Japanese prison, if not for a daring escape to his homeland, Lebanon.

## Influence in Network and Virtual Organizations

But what to do if an organization has no center of power? What if there's no structure there at all? Increasingly we observe organizations with very low formal hierarchy—from high-tech startups to virtual volunteer groups. They feel and behave like distributed networks. However, even there not all people are equal. Whom should you orient toward in developing relationships? How can you identify power centers in non-hierarchical organizations? How can you increase your influence there? Let's try to answer these questions.

In an ideal hierarchical organization, such as, for example, the military, your power is a function of "vertical height" in the organizational structure. All power is delegated from above. To increase your "weight," you have only one way—climb the organizational ladder.

But what to do if the organization isn't just networked but entirely virtual, for example an internet community—as in IT or creative industries? How to build your influence there? To describe the distribution of forces in networks, let's use a metaphor. When on a clear night you look at the sky, you primarily notice either stars familiar to you, or stars that look larger because they're closer to Earth, or those distinguished by extraordinary brightness, or so-called "shooting" stars that suddenly cross the sky, or, finally, large constellations.

The same principles operate in the virtual world. Just the same, to have influence and consequently certain power in a personal network, you must be either well-known, or be in someone's closest circle of communication, or prove yourself a remarkable, bright personality, or be engaged in something unusual, or be part of a well-recognized, respected group. If you want to become more noticeable, more important in the network, you need to think about how to get into one of the described categories.

To be visible, known, you need to become a kind of "driver" of interactions, discussions, create traffic around yourself—become the owner of a node in the communication platform. You need to become a virtual "connector."

If you want to get closer to specific people, you need to offer them some value. You can find and share information that's of interest to them, take part in their discussions, in solving their problems. This will give you a reason to contact them directly.

But is it easy to become a "bright star"? If you're not confident in the value of your own ideas, you can become a skillful aggregator of others'. Become the "king of content," a person to whom one can turn for useful information. Create a kind of knowledge exchange platform. People who don't have time for detailed, lengthy searches will go straight to you. It will be even better if you can create a reputation as a source of "cool material." This is precisely the role bloggers play, whose audience often reaches millions of subscribers.

Finally, a bit about recognizable "constellations." As in real life, try to communicate with recognizable, interesting people. By participating in their chats and commenting on their posts, you'll become associated with "your own," attract attention to yourself, and achieve recognition in the online communities that interest you. In short, get your status "by association."

# Chapter 7. Up the Social Ladder

For a spy, creating a network of contacts isn't the ultimate goal—it's only a necessary base and tool for achieving a more important task. A spy must constantly raise their social status and climb the social ladder. If they don't do this, their value will remain quite limited. Those who have access to secrets and are involved in important decisions are at the top of society, whether politicians, government officials, or leading scientists. If you're not interesting to them, if you don't belong to the same social strata, if they can't benefit from your knowledge and contacts, if your personality doesn't excite them, they'll have no desire to deal with you.

## Social Capital

Constant ascent up the social ladder has another name—accumulation of personal social capital. Without delving into concepts of social disciplines, social capital is the goodwill, recognition, and help you receive from people you know in your surrounding community. It's precisely the result of accumulated positive interaction with surrounding people that gives you the right to privileges of inclusion in the community with all its possible advantages—material and intangible. Put simply, social capital is "who you know" from the old saying "It's not what you know, it's who you know."

Networking creates social capital. The magnitude of social capital, or reputation, is a function of your personal and professional value multiplied by success in networking. Your place in society is, in essence, your accumulated social capital. Speaking in business language, your social status is personal "capital" in which "profit" is that social capital you accumulate each year. Your networking results are your "income." The better your personal contact network, the better and stronger your position in corresponding circles.

The value of strategy in networking becomes most obvious if you consider that your efficiency—the ratio of results of strengthening your status to efforts expended—depends on how well you've set priorities.

For illustration, let's quote American career coach Bonnie Marcus from Forbes magazine: "A strong personal network is like money in the bank. Your network can help you become visible, connect with influential people, and open doors to new opportunities. Building and developing a network is one of the most powerful things you can do to support your own career growth. Nevertheless, often our networking efforts are reduced merely to empty small talk, are unsystematic, and, as a consequence, ineffective. You make friends and connections, but not always are these people able to help in your further career or, most importantly, put in a good word for you at the right moment." The quote may seem long, but it shows how important good strategy is in networking...

## How to Turn Contacts into Social Capital

Methods for building social capital and social status can also be divided into micro- and macro-. As discussed earlier, the method with the prefix micro- is aimed at improving influence on people around you, and macro- at your position in society as a whole. According to the micro-methodology, there are three proven ways to increase your social capital by relying on your network of contacts. We've already mentioned some of them earlier, but here they're worth repeating.

First, get closer to communication centers, to "connectors." Whether it's about a company, local community, or any organization, try to become a kind of "exchange manager," well, or universal intermediary—this way you'll find yourself at the main node of all relationships. The more central and noticeable your position becomes—the better. Being proactive and being a volunteer are keys to success. On one hand, being at the center of communications will help you "build" necessary bridges, expanding your network's reach. On the other hand, such a position will provide opportunities to do many good deeds: share information, show care and participation, offer help, redirect resources. The next step is to become indispensable, that is, a person who knows everyone and helps everyone. The game is worth the candle. The respect, gratitude, access to information, and new opportunities acquired in the process will more than cover all your "operating costs."

Surprisingly, "connector" positions in many groups and organizations are practically vacant. Maybe this is because most people are lazy or afraid to take initiative and responsibility for communication flows. True, such work really does take much time and effort. When one of us volunteered to revive the overseas alumni network of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, they immediately understood that no one had dealt with this before, at least there were no official records of it at the institution. If few were attracted to the "connector" position in such a famous organization, what can be said about other groups and communities?

Second, try to create your "advisory board," staff it with people who are respected and who inspire universal admiration. This doesn't have to be a formal group, and your advisors don't have to know each other personally. It's important that these people be capable of playing a positive role in your personal growth or helping your career by giving advice and connections.

The term "advisory board" sounds too "corporate," however the practice of surrounding yourself with experienced, knowledgeable people is universal. Several years ago, after the first lecture in a lecture series that one of the authors of this book gives at MGIMO in Moscow, a student approached him and offered to become his assistant for the course. During the semester, several lengthy conversations took place with her in which questions far beyond the lectures were discussed, and the book's author shared his experience and essentially acted as a coach. At the end of the course, the author agreed to become the student's advisor for her thesis, and later gave her a good recommendation when she was getting a job. Most remarkably, the girl, as it turned out later, offered her help to professors on almost every course of which she was an attendee. Imagine how much advice, help, and good connections she received over her years of study! We're confident she'll become a skillful diplomat and excellent networker.

It's very important to have among your advisors and mentors "rising stars" who can pull you along when they, in turn, raise their status. For a spy, searching for "rising stars" is one of the most important tasks. Such proactive work pays off handsomely. It's enough to refer to the example of Richard Moore, head of the British Secret Service. After joining MI-6, Moore spent several years in Turkey in the early 1990s. There he studied Turkish and was an active fan of the local football club Beşiktaş, which translated from social terminology to professional means he was engaged in recruiting members of Istanbul's elite. At that time, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was just beginning his political career in Istanbul. The efforts invested bore fruit many years later when Richard Moore became the United Kingdom's ambassador to Turkey and one of Erdoğan's most valuable supporters and influential friends. Surely not without the help of mutual acquaintances acquired thirty years ago!

Third, it's necessary to get closer to real leaders—key figures in the company or community. Here your task is simple—learn from them, comprehending something new and useful for yourself. After all, to occupy their current position, such people undertook something, accomplished something—and, judging by the results, these were the right actions. Most likely, they understand the essence of the real world and their own organizations better than others—and better than you. In addition, they have access to certain resources. Getting closer to influential people, you get the opportunity to learn something from them, imitate their approaches and behavior. Ideally, you should strive to make them your mentors—in hope that someday you'll inherit their connections and status.

The famous Soviet spy Iosif Grigulevich (1913-1988) under the name Teodoro B. Castro passed himself off as the illegitimate son of a wealthy Costa Rican coffee producer. In Rome he founded an import-export company and established extensive personal contacts with local businessmen—especially those close to the Catholic Church. Over time, he managed to become a close friend and business partner of the former president of Costa Rica. As a result, in 1951 "Teodoro B. Castro" was appointed ambassador of Costa Rica to Italy and the Vatican, which made him a key insider at the top of the Catholic Church and Italian political circles.

## Riding "Social Elevators"

When it comes to your position in society as a whole, raising your social status is akin to riding social elevators. You need to understand which elevators go up and find a way to jump into them.

Thinking about your status in strategic perspective, we can say that the choices we periodically have to make in life can bring us to different career trajectories—some higher, others lower. Some life paths look preferable from the very beginning—birth into a family of wealthy and influential parents clearly facilitates life and career just as getting maximum scores on the EGE (Unified State Exam) or American SAT test (Scholastic Assessment Test) gives you more chances to enter Moscow State University or Stanford. However, even if we can't control our starting point, the further trajectory of our life depends on choices we make. These trajectories don't necessarily lead you upward. Many smart children of famous parents ultimately become worthless people, alcoholics, or drug addicts. Good education, correct choice of profession, business industry and workplace, successful friends, and a supportive spouse can radically change your life trajectory. At any moment in life, you can find yourself at an "elevator"—with short-term and long-term opportunities—and this "elevator" will help bring your life to a higher level. You simply need to look for these elevators and be ready to jump into them. Since almost all chances for further advancement depend on whether you know the right people, your life strategy and networking strategy must work as one whole. Your task is to create an "elevator of opportunities" for yourself as a professional spy would do.

## Education—Your "Ticket" Upward

The most obvious, simple, and accessible social elevator is education. Practically any educational program will raise your competencies and status. The best of them can become reliable conductors to elite circles. Our intelligence career included training in four university programs; the outcome of the last was a master's degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in the prestigious USA. This was a difficult climb to the "peaks" if you take into account that we began our path in an unfamiliar country without even a high school diploma. At night we had to study, and during the day—work.

However, the most significant gain from education isn't the new knowledge you receive but the new people you meet. Educational space—universities, short-term business programs, professional courses—is the most open and egalitarian environment in society. This allows people from different strata to communicate with each other without the social barriers that one way or another are present in everyday life. If you want to create connections beyond your daily sphere of communication, you won't find a better place.

In addition, people come to study because either they're seeking new knowledge and opportunities or are dissatisfied with themselves and their current work. This means they're searching for themselves and are open to everything new—including new friends. If you want to fill your network with interesting and successful people, educational institutions have no equal in this sense.

## Join Status Groups

What else can bring you to a better trajectory and raise status? Of course, a place in status groups. Joining private clubs, attending exclusive events—these are quite obvious but often expensive choices. Therefore, we suggest considering other options: professional societies, non-profit organizations, alumni associations, cigar and wine clubs, sports teams, political parties, as well as groups advocating various issues of public importance. Study options for participation in volunteer work and think tank presentations, helping sponsor public events, amateur theaters, and exhibitions.

There's a wonderful example of a person who made a name and career for himself as an organizer of status events. His name is Klaus Schwab. Being a 33-year-old professor at a Swiss university, he created a discussion platform now known as the World Economic Forum. Schwab can be considered an unsurpassed networker. He skillfully used his organization to establish connections with presidents and kings around the world. But his most remarkable achievement is that he created a networking machine that did this work for him! As they say, we take our hat off to such talent!

While you're building your career and climbing the corporate ladder, you naturally spend most time with people inside or around your business and profession. However, if you want to establish yourself in the upper strata of society, you'll need to make a special emphasis on expanding your network and creating connections outside your professional sphere.

There are periods of rapid career growth, but never say never to stagnation and even falls. Your status in professional circles is strongly tied to the status of your workplace. If you're unlucky, it may happen that your colleagues lose interest in you. The same will happen when you retire. However, relationships that arose in other spheres of life will most likely persist. After all, they're based not so much on business and professional interests as on all sorts of other interests.

As an additional bonus, a wide spectrum of connections in different spheres will allow you to become a "connector" for your friends and establish exchange of "relationship currency." And, most importantly, you'll have what money can't buy—an interesting and diverse life!

## Enter the Public Space

Another way to raise your social status is to become a publicly known person. To occupy a prominent place in society, you don't have to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature or become a senator. Even average bloggers usually have up to several hundred thousand subscribers. If you have interesting content, then to convey it to the rest of the world, you don't need to own media platforms like CNN, RT, or Al Jazeera. Practically any acquired fame gives you levers of influence in the public space and raises your status. Here, again, content plays a key role! So, if there's an opportunity, write, make a film, or release interesting material. If you don't feel you're capable of creating good content independently, become a content aggregator, manager of a content platform under your own name. The spectrum of content is truly limitless—from cooking lessons to international politics.

Any attempts to undertake something interesting or unusual will inevitably attract other people to you, regardless of whether you're crossing a continent by bicycle or writing a book about how to grow tomatoes. You'll get a double effect. First, you'll find yourself in a new...
