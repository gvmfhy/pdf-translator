## Your Information Sources

In our time, there are masses of ways to collect information about practically any person. Most of us leave a solid information trail consisting of posts on virtual social networks and presence in numerous public databases. To start, simply google. If you found some basic information—about what the person does, where they work and live—google these organizations, look at maps of the area where they're located. Information will help you imagine what surrounds the person every day, what they have to deal with, what they might feel. Simply put yourself in their place...

However, as always, the best and most current information still comes from people, and the closer they are to the target of your interest, the better. The simplest and surest way to understand a person is to ask those who know them. There's nothing wrong with you asking such questions—if you can explain why you need this information. If you want to meet with a person, then there's your reason. Just go and do it! As spies, we had to exercise special caution not to arouse suspicions, but for everyone else it's much simpler. On the contrary, it might even awaken curiosity in the person you're questioning.

When police or special services require more information about a suspect but need to do it secretly, without publicity, they develop quite convoluted ways to talk with their colleagues and neighbors, pretending to be couriers, sociologists, former girlfriends, and so on. You'd be surprised to learn how much information a person living next door can tell a stranger about you, provided the stranger knows how to ask about it correctly. During training in intelligence preparation, we conducted dozens of such "neighbor interviews," each of which required comprehensive role-play development to properly prepare reactions to all possible answers.

In many cases, the meeting place itself provides some basic information that helps in establishing contact. Conferences and other thematic events are actually designed to give people the opportunity to meet each other. In addition to coffee breaks, stands with contact information, and specially designated meeting places, such events provide detailed information about speakers and participants, giving everyone the opportunity to visit the corresponding website before a personal meeting and get a preliminary idea. It makes sense to run through the participant list and mark potentially interesting people for yourself in advance, as well as read about speakers. All this will make your contacts more purposeful and first conversations more fruitful. By becoming a speaker at an event, you'll thereby further increase your chances of becoming noticeable and acquiring new acquaintances.

# Chapter 3. First Contact

Any relationship between people begins with first contact—whether at a personal meeting or in virtual space. Not for nothing do they say: "you never get a second chance to make a first impression." First contact is even more important for a spy: inability to make the right first impression not only prevents entering someone's trust or, say, earning more: often it puts an end to a carefully planned operation and nullifies the efforts of many people.

Thanks largely to Hollywood, most people imagine spies as cold, calculating, even excessively closed and cautious. Recall Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow in the popular franchise from Marvel Comics. Although, to tell the truth, the opposite is actually true! The most successful spies are, as a rule, pleasant, friendly, and extremely open people.

Perhaps this is that rare case when James Bond in his image isn't so far from the truth. His charm and seduction skills are far more effective than any of Q's clever gadgets he hides on himself. Interestingly, neighbors of exposed spies whose names subsequently became public knowledge overwhelmingly considered them among the very best people they'd ever met... And that's how it should be! To become a good spy—or a good networker—it's very important to be able to make a positive impression. Rufina Pukhova-Philby, Russian wife of the famous Englishman Kim Philby, who collaborated with Soviet intelligence for many years, recounted that her husband had such charm "that you wanted to tell him everything." In Moscow, he taught young spies this charm. He invented role-playing games. He himself played the role now of a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, now of a border officer.

That's why much in a spy's training is specially directed at maximum effectiveness in first contact. Our training usually included such exercises as establishing contact with a random person from whom specific information had to be "extracted."

For a spy, work on a "target contact" can begin long before personal acquaintance. That's precisely why we divide all initial contacts into two categories—prepared and spontaneous. They differ not only in the time you must spend forming an opinion about the person you're meeting, but also in risk, rather symbolic for ordinary people but very significant for an operative worker.

## First Meeting Scenarios

There are two possible scenarios for prepared initial contact. The first and best way to establish initial contact is, obviously, to be introduced by someone. Ideally, such an intermediary who introduces you to the right person should do so personally. Their presence is extremely necessary. Your friend vouches for you, immediately creating certain trust in the eyes of the person with whom you're becoming acquainted. If among your friends you can gather several such "connectors," this will ultimately give you a constant influx of new contacts in communication with whom "the ice," as they say, has already been broken. The interesting effect of "one of us" can be observed when you use some club or professional association as a platform for establishing contacts. As an insider—a member of the club or community—you enjoy this effect of camaraderie that helps you skip the very first stage of building relationships, when emotional interaction between people hasn't yet been established. For example, when someone brings a new person to our cigar club, by the end of the evening you can hear how new buddies are already fully discussing business plans or joint trips—thereby demonstrating a level of trust that in other circumstances would be simply unthinkable after a first meeting.

The second scenario is when after careful evaluation of a person, you use or create circumstances under which you and your "target" can enter into conversation. In both cases, it's most useful to study the person's character and sphere of interests as well as possible. This will allow you to prepare a number of topics for discussion representing interest to your contact, so that you can then maintain joint communication. Your questions need to give your interlocutor the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and status and feel that you value all this. In addition, such questions should serve as a pretext for subsequent contacts.

## How to Overcome Fear of Talking to a Stranger

However well you prepare, you're naturally haunted by the fear that your first contact will fall through. There's no point fighting these fears or trying to avoid them! Even after thousands of spontaneous contacts, we still worry before the next meeting. Although such fear can disorient and demotivate you, it can also make you focus better and ultimately achieve more. A healthy, normal attitude toward fear and stress can become a priceless asset in all spheres of life.

One of us once recalled their own fear before the first parachute jump. The ground was far, far below, and stepping into this emptiness seemed physically unnatural. Suddenly came the thought that almost everyone who made the same jump into the abyss ultimately landed safely—that is, in this game of chances, the numbers were firmly on the side of success. Yes, there are moments when you simply need to believe... At that moment, belief in success helped tame the fear, and it also allowed establishment of many "cold" contacts later.

Over time, you'll learn to manage your fear of communication. Spontaneous contacts are, in essence, the same lottery. Some attempts will surely turn out unsuccessful. Sometimes you'll receive categorical refusal that will unpleasantly hurt your ego. You'll be left with painful memories. But in the overwhelming majority of interactions, everything will work as it should. We guarantee it! So don't stop and make your jump!

## How to Prevent Rejection

During conversation, you'll have to balance between two opposite tasks—how to get the person interested in you, and how not to provoke rejection. No contact will work out if the object of your interest doesn't want to deal with you or, worse still, fears you. You must create appropriate conditions for involving the person in conversation.

Most advice you'll find in networking books comes down to establishing contacts during a coffee break at some conference or at a party when everyone is disposed to it. However, spies often have to work in an environment when acquaintance is difficult or unwelcome. Successfully involving people in conversation under such circumstances is already mastery of a completely different order.

The main thing stopping a person from full interaction with you is lack of clarity about who you are and what you want. Meeting you for the first time, people consciously or unconsciously assess risks and opportunities arising from acquaintance. What do you want from the new connection? What if you ask for something the person can't or won't give? Will their reputation deteriorate because of you? Are you a boring or interesting interlocutor? Can you provide useful connections? Therefore, a professional spy specially prepares to dispel the concerns of the person they're meeting as quickly as possible. The key question to which an operative worker must give a convincing answer sounds like "Why are you approaching me?" And until you offer your interlocutor an understandable reason for your interest, the person will be uncomfortable with you. The art of a professional lies in finding or inventing such a reason.

Quite recently I witnessed how you can ruin a seemingly completely guaranteed contact if you ignore the above-mentioned rule. One of my friends suggested I meet for three with an "interesting person"—the local head of one of the famous international clubs. Knowing my friend as an active "connector," I assumed that the conversation would be about involving me in the club's work. And then everything developed according to the most "disastrous" scenario. First, the "connector" himself didn't show up for the meeting, not even really trying to make excuses. Second, the "interesting person" himself was seriously late. Then he began talking about himself, about his projects and his hobbies. The club topic was raised in passing and only at my prompting. But most importantly, I never understood why he was meeting with me. During the entire conversation, my interlocutor never tried to find out what would interest me and offered nothing. The loneliness of my coffee cup on the table also didn't dispose toward a long conversation. We parted with complete understanding that there would be no continuation.

You'll also provoke rejection by showing too much initiative in cases when it's not welcome. A bit of personal experience. Many, many years ago, we as ambitious operatives often suffered from excessive ambitiousness. We wanted to achieve quick results, and this unambiguously manifested in our behavior. Now, recalling those first years from the height of acquired experience, it's even awkward to admit that we probably ruined quite a few good contacts then because we behaved too "pushily"!

Here's just one example from our many years of experience. Upon arriving in the United States, we became part of an exclusive community at one of America's leading universities. We received an incredible chance to gain masses of useful contacts. Many of our fellow students could potentially become important political figures, employees of government and military organizations, and even leaders of foreign countries. Truly a gold mine for a spy! Since the program lasted only one year, we felt we couldn't waste time. Having identified several "targets" for ourselves, we set about purposefully developing relationships with them. The very first contact—with a student with a military past—seemed especially promising. Encouraged by his first reaction, we used every opportunity to deepen the relationship: stayed to chat after classes, invited to lunch, met over coffee, visited local attractions together. Encouraged by seeming progress, we didn't take into account his need to communicate with other people too, especially at the beginning of studies when relationships between fellow students are just forming. In addition, as we subsequently learned, he had romantic designs on one of the students. In our desire to occupy the place of his "best friends," we didn't immediately guess that such persistence began to produce the opposite effect. Very soon the person simply began avoiding us. The relationship came to naught, and despite all our efforts, unfortunately, we couldn't restore it. The acquaintance distanced himself from us and preferred closer communication with other students. Fortunately, when in subsequent contacts we tried to build more balanced relationships with people, we achieved far greater success.

## "Behavioral Hygiene"

When you meet a person for the first time, it's necessary to give them enough time so they can get a better look at you, evaluate you, and get used to your presence. If you find yourself in the same room, try to spend some time in the field of vision of a potential contact so they can observe you. If you plan to speak, start with some predictable and positive topic. Not surprisingly, many conversations between strangers begin with banal remarks about the weather—it is what it is!

In addition to attempts to prevent fear connected with invading the personal space of the object of your interest during spontaneous contacts, you need to pay special attention to observing rules of so-called "behavioral hygiene." Your contact shouldn't feel any threat or concern. For example, showing up at an art gallery intoxicated and talking loudly, you'll create in your person a negative "attractor," becoming a "black sheep" in strangers' eyes and provoking their defensive reaction.

Take measures to eliminate all possible "impression killers": from bad breath and dirty fingernails to verbosity, excessively loud voice, or uncontrolled leg movements that people often make when nervous. And last but not least—without a smile and relaxed posture, you're unlikely to make a positive impression!

Perform a simple test: sit down for ten minutes somewhere in a shopping center or cafe and observe the people around. Some are sitting, some pass by. Divide them into two groups: those you'd like to meet, and those to whom you're absolutely not disposed. Agree: faces of the first category will look relaxed, confident, and smiling. That's exactly how you yourself should look if you want to attract someone.

People are most comfortable with those who resemble themselves, whom they understand. Ideally, you should dress and behave as a member of their social group, whether business or something else. If you manage to find out something about the person's occupation or interests before establishing contact with them, you can take a book related to their profession with you. This can also turn out to be a good aid in conversation.

If we'd written this book a generation ago, our standard recommendation would be to dress "well"—conservatively and even expensively, but now, when even billionaires wear nothing but T-shirts, former advice lacks particular meaning. Instead, we recommend you look "recognizable" so that your "target" can easily associate you with one of the respectable social types. For example, with a top laptop or tablet in hand, you'll easily pass for an IT professional. Many social classes and professions have their own unofficial uniform, whether venture investors in Patagonia vests, bankers in expensive dark blue pinstripe suits, or professors in tweed blazers with leather elbow patches. Let's hope that in any case you won't have a bloody knife or smoking gun in your hands, because otherwise your prospective contact will run away in fear...

If you can't look like a person from your contact's sphere of activity, try at least not to alert them with extravagances in clothing and things (unless you yourself are a movie star or some important person). If you want to strike up a conversation with a person in the neighboring seat on an airplane, wait until they get better settled, calm down, and begin to take interest in the surrounding environment. To play along a bit, try copying their pre-flight routine: take out several magazines, a pen or glasses; check messages on your phone screen. Or render your neighbor some small service without attracting special attention to your person: pass a bag or napkin. The moment when flight attendants serve drinks and food throughout the cabin is especially convenient for starting a conversation.
