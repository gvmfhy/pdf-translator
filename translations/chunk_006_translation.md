## The Art of Spontaneous Contacts

Sometimes you'll have no choice but to start a conversation without any information about the person standing before you. Such spontaneous contacts require special mastery. The main challenge facing you in spontaneous contact is ensuring continuation of interaction after the first meeting. You'll have to maintain conversation with a stranger while simultaneously trying to obtain enough information about the interlocutor's past, interests, or character to propose the next meeting.

Unfortunately, this isn't the only challenge for you. Despairing of interesting the person, many of us unconsciously begin to "advertise" ourselves. They tell how smart they are, how rich, how many important "bigwigs" they know. And they fail. As beginning spies, we repeatedly fell into such psychological traps. Yes, sometimes it's not bad to "sell" yourself a bit to somehow attract a person to you, but this is only a secondary task.

Instead, you should focus on making the person "buy you." The goal is that your contact should find it pleasant to deal with you. People are ruled by emotions. Creating pleasant sensations in your interlocutor during conversation means demonstrating your sympathy toward them. You need to set aside your ego and sincerely focus all attention on the person before you, showing your interest in them. Make an effort and try to almost love this person. All people, even very shy ones, love to talk about themselves. You've surely heard someone called the most pleasant person and best interlocutor merely because they didn't interrupt the speaker. Think about it! How, in your opinion, do psychotherapists create an environment in which a patient feels closeness and trust?

First contact requires you to completely focus on the reaction of the person of interest to you. The task is to develop and deepen this interaction and, God forbid, not push away a potential connection. You must be able to read the reaction to your words and gestures to clearly determine whether it allows continuing communication. The answer doesn't necessarily have to be verbal. Behind polite phrases may hide a demand to "back off," expressed through intonation or gestures. To assess the true reaction, focus your sensations on the emotional "temperature" of the interaction.

Awareness that our movements and subconscious actions constitute a significant part of interpersonal communication has become so widespread that the term "body language" has firmly entered modern lexicon. As spies, we practiced for many years the subtle art of demonstrating our own accessibility while simultaneously "reading" the interlocutor's subconscious signals.

Many books have been published with recommendations for reading signs of "body language." Some authors even reference their experience working in special services. However, as professionals with many years of operative work experience, we're honestly skeptical about their practical value for a beginning networker. First of all, the overwhelming majority of manifestations of people's physical reactions have not only strong cultural but also situational specificity. For example, almost universal gestures of goodwill and beginning conversation—such as a smile and direct eye contact—in some cultures can be considered excessively intrusive and even embarrassing. Reading other, even less obvious signs in people whose national origin and social behavior often have mixed character becomes increasingly difficult. In addition, we're raised from childhood to be polite and suppress true emotional reaction, especially with strangers.

Instead of trying to recognize any specific signs, a good networker must be able to catch and interpret the entire flow of behavioral signals coming from a person during interaction. Individual signals are less significant than the overall picture. If you carefully monitor the emotional state of those around you, you'll most likely catch signs of mood changes—irritation, boredom, hurry, or disapproval from a person of practically any culture and be able to react accordingly.

## Synchronization of Sensations

During interaction, your task is to synchronize your sensations with your interlocutor's feelings—to see yourself as they see you. This requires empathy. An example of such emotional synchronization is a situation when an interviewer, listening attentively, unconsciously imitates the interlocutor's posture and head tilt. To read a person's emotions, you need to mobilize your Emotional Intelligence abilities.

You've probably already heard about Emotional Intelligence (EI). Unlike "traditional" intelligence, which measures how "smart" a person is, EI focuses on a person's ability to be "wise" in dealing with their own emotions and others' emotions. There's a very good book on this topic by Daniel Goleman. He was one of the first to draw attention to the fact that a person's ability to understand others on an emotional level influences work success more than their professional skills.

Emotional Intelligence is our ability to understand our emotions, understand where they came from and what influences them. On one hand, awareness of one's emotional state allows controlling and managing one's own behavior. On the other hand, it provides the opportunity to correctly read others' emotions and behave in accordance with the current moment and social environment. You must have encountered speakers who continue boring presentations, absolutely not taking into account that half the listeners are already nodding off. This means the speakers don't know how to "read" the audience. They don't feel viewers on an emotional level, don't "empathize" with them in the current situation.

In networking, you need to keep your eyes and ears open to read another person's emotional state, detect changes in behavior, and correspondingly correct your action strategy. For a spy, constant observation of their own behavior and interlocutor's reactions becomes second nature. They live as if a GoPro video camera is mounted on each contact's head and they constantly receive audio and video stream with which they track their mistakes.

As practical advice for developing your own emotional intelligence, try spending a day with the "camera on," analyzing your sensations and feelings of people around you. You'll have something to think about!

By focusing all attention on your interlocutor, you simultaneously solve another problem people often complain about in first spontaneous contact—how not to forget the interlocutor's name. When you're told that someone couldn't remember the names of people they met at a party or meeting, this usually means it wasn't so important to them. We've never heard of anyone not remembering their new boss's name.

Honestly speaking, neither of us has special talent in remembering names. However, there's a three-step method that helps remember names. First, after you hear your interlocutor's name, try to use it as often as possible in the next several phrases of conversation. And if you still forget the name—ask again. If you've just met, there's nothing shameful in this. Second, try coming up with some nickname for your interlocutor based on how the person looks, what they do, or how you met—such associations stimulate memory well. And finally, write down the name you heard in a notebook or phone, and at the end of the conversation ask them to give you a business card. This will not only engage your visual memory but also warm your interlocutor's ego—they'll be convinced they made an impression on you.

## Initial Sorting – The "OIS" Method

In case of spontaneous contact, you can't allow yourself such a luxury as preliminary information about the person. It helps not only prepare good topics for conversation to interest the person but also make sure that communication with them won't create problems later. That's precisely why spontaneous contacts will require a spy to "analyze" and "sort" those they're meeting by the "OIS" method.

Meeting a person for the first time, a professional spy, regardless of how much time they have before handshake—months or seconds—must answer three critically important questions about the person: is they dangerous? interesting? difficult?

Such a scheme is very useful when you find yourself in the midst of a welcome party at a conference or, for example, at a distant relative's birthday. In both cases, you're surrounded by unfamiliar people.

Let's start with the "Dangerous" point. If a spy is somehow connected or even fleetingly noticed in the company of persons sought by police or participating in extremist organizations, this can mean surveillance or investigation, possibly with catastrophic results. The same applies to meetings with people from counterintelligence, criminal police, diplomats, or those who work in secret government laboratories. Accidental, unprepared contact with such people can easily lead to investigation and arrest.

For those far from the spy world, the list of dangerous contacts isn't so short either. Do you want to be associated with those who manifest hatred and threaten other people? Or with those who sell drugs? It's completely obvious that if you see or sense a potential problem—just leave. You'll be surprised how many emotionally unstable people are around. Their mood can change instantly, especially if you start arguing with them. And if you maintain conversation hoping it will somehow calm them, they'll "latch on" to you like ticks. And then getting rid of them will be almost impossible. If you think you're unlikely to meet such people in your environment—don't be so sure, think carefully!

When we were still undergoing training, one of our mentors who worked undercover in Asia for more than ten years told us a story. It once again emphasized the need to be extremely attentive in evaluating people with whom you enter into contact. In a hotel bar in one Southeast Asian capital, he met a person who in every way resembled a prosperous European businessman. After several shots, they found common interest: both were newcomers to the country and both planned to open their own business. The opportunity to invest in business with a "respectable gentleman" who, by his own words, already "had influential friends in the country," seemed too attractive to miss. However, from the first minute of meeting this person, our spy was alerted by something. By the end of the evening, he finally understood what it was: the gentleman had untidy fingernails with visible dirt under them. Later, after another check, it turned out this was a well-known local swindler. During the day he worked as a gardener to somehow make ends meet, and in the evening he switched to his "main business"...

For those who passed the "D-test" (Dangerous), there's a second evaluation stage—point "I" (Interesting). Not all contacts are created equal. Your time and resources are limited. You have to be pragmatic. If after some communication you don't see potential interest for yourself, slow down and think: either you'll "freeze" work with this contact for now, recording their details to make a decision later, or simply refuse them by skillfully ending the conversation.

By the way, beautifully ending a conversation is itself a mastery. If you do this incorrectly, your interlocutors will feel you treated them with disdain and will never forgive you for it. Exiting a conversation must be carefully prepared and correspond to the setting. We're sure you've been in situations when some people "stick" to you at the beginning of a party and don't let go for several hours, almost physically preventing you from communicating with others. Surely you, like us, can't stand such situations. In addition, such people prevented us from doing our work! Over time, we developed a whole set of excuse phrases from simple "Let me go to the restroom" to phone calls to each other that we presented as urgent requests from foreign business partners. We provoked such calls with secret signals known only to us two. We suggest you agree on something similar with a close friend or partner.

And finally, point "D" ("Difficult"). Unfortunately, sometimes even with quite interesting people it's very difficult to build relationships. This may be connected with significant differences in age or social position. But most often the reason is absence of favorable "chemistry." Having gained experience, sometimes already at the very early stage of interaction you'll begin to understand that no "chemistry" can be there. If you continue maintaining contact in the same spirit, such relationships will drag on without substantial progress in development and trust in each other. They'll turn out awkward, boring, formal, artificial, and difficult to maintain. Nothing useful will come of them. We're sure you have experience with such relationships. If there are no compelling reasons to preserve them, except the same family or financial obligations—let the situation go. You'll feel relief and, by the way, save yourself time. Here, again, if you doubt you can extract benefit from the relationship—just take the person's contact information and move on.

## How to Start a Conversation with Different Types of People

With spontaneous contacts, the question arises of how to start a conversation with different types of people. Describing basic character types and subtleties of communicating with them would require a separate book. Nevertheless, it's worth dwelling on how to act when meeting the most common types you'll be able to recognize even before entering into contact or in the first stages of conversation. Without delving into scientific terminology, let's take our personal operative experience as a basis.

It's easiest to start a conversation with "great communicators." These are people who are ready to talk to you even without your initiative to that end. Usually there's a smile on their face and in their eyes—restless interest in everything around them. They can't sit still without talking to someone anyway. You just need not to scare them away. One smile in their direction, a nod of the head, or a comment on any occasion will suffice to "turn them on." They'll gladly tell about themselves—you'll only have to manage the conversation by asking the right questions. The problem is how to "turn them off" afterward if you don't see interest in continuing contact. Unfortunately, for understandable reasons, among "great communicators" there aren't very many people vested with power and even fewer bearers of secrets.

Another type is represented by people who want to be the "center of attention." You'll recognize them by exclusive clothing, noticeable "artistry" in behavior, originality in choice of ties, gadgets, or jewelry. To confirm their self-worth, they need external attention and admiration. They do everything to be noticed, although this doesn't at all mean they want to strike up a conversation with someone. The key to starting conversation with such people is in a compliment that will let them understand that their efforts to be original and unique have been noticed and properly appreciated. In further conversation, they'll gladly talk about themselves. And if even before conversation starts they catch your interested and admiring glance—it will only be better!

If the first two types are by nature expressive and ready to support conversation themselves, the next two, as a rule, represent real difficulty for first contact. One of these difficult types is the "controller," who can be distinguished among others by a serious, focused gaze and position that allows them to better control everything happening around. Usually this is a perfectionist who respects life by the rules and often strives to impose their rules on others. In first contact with a "controller," your strategy consists of confirming that you too value order, understanding the rules this person follows, and perhaps even demonstrating your readiness to accept them. Therefore, in the first conversation it's worth focusing your questions on finding out how your interlocutor sees the world, what is "good" or "bad" in their coordinate system, while simultaneously giving them the opportunity to "impose" their vision on you. Beginning conversation with perfectionist controllers could quite well be a critical remark about some obvious problem, like flight delay...

And finally, the most difficult type for first contact—the "closed off." Such a person is usually in a position of "circular defense" in relation to the rest of the world. They trust no one and look for a catch everywhere. In public, such people are shy, silent, and focused on something of their own. Starting conversation with the "closed off" without an obvious, evident, important reason that would justify their risky exit from their "fortress" is unlikely to work. Even if you ask for help, there's no guarantee you'll receive it. Therefore, starting conversation with the "closed off" often resembles a psychotherapist's conversation with a patient. Your main task is to calm them. Moreover, due to high anxiety, the very physical approach to the "closed off" to a distance allowing starting conversation requires time and tact—the person must have enough time to adapt their world to your presence. One of us had a case when before speaking for the first time with one such "closed off" person, they had to spend almost a week at a neighboring table in the city library!

## How to Present Yourself Properly

It's quite predictable that in the head of the person you're meeting, it will first flash: "Who is he?" They'll immediately mentally begin a verification process similar to the "Dangerous-Interesting-Difficult" test we described earlier. Your task is to successfully pass such verification. The first impression of you will be visual, so we strongly recommend excluding all possible "red flags" in your appearance and, if possible, looking the same as your interlocutor.

As soon as you start conversation, you'll need to tell something about yourself, explaining what you're doing here and why you want to talk. You must give the person a good reason for conversation. In the operative language of intelligence, such an explanation is called "situational cover." We suggest you rehearse it in advance so it sounds smooth and answers the immediate questions arising in a person approached by a stranger.

A phrase like "...just finished a consulting project and would like to see the city center before flying to London tomorrow" might quite "work." After such words, the image forming in the person's head will consist of a number of positive points. You're a consultant. You probably have good education and decent income, so you're not going to ask for a loan. You give the impression of a person who travels a lot, so you might turn out to be quite an interesting interlocutor. You're inquisitive, and you have a bit of free time in reserve, which is why you started a conversation.

By the way, when you're preparing your "cover legend" to start a conversation with a stranger, we advise not lying about yourself. If you want to make a better impression and add facts to your story that don't correspond to reality, remember that sometimes strangers become close friends and may hear the whole truth about you from others later!

## How to Manage a Spontaneous Conversation

If you have enough information about the person you're meeting, pre-prepared topics for conversation and questions will give you the opportunity to manage the discussion. However, to start and maintain conversation with a person you don't know, you'll have to look for other approaches.

So far, no secret recipes have been created for starting and maintaining conversation with a person you don't know. All your ideas for how to do this you're forced to draw from three sources: the personality with whom you wanted to enter into contact, circumstances of the meeting, and finally, yourself. The art of conversation with a stranger lies in using your imagination and ability to squeeze maximum from such a rather limited set of options.

What ideas can come from the "target"? First, you can offer help if they have some problem. A person may drop something, stumble, or their phone battery may die. Perhaps it only seems to you that the person has problems, but this too will serve as a pretext. In both cases, you can introduce yourself and offer help. Second, a person may do something or look such that it naturally...
