## Synopsis

Illegal intelligence officers who spent many years working under deep cover share their unique personal experience working with people. This book aims to help readers become designers of their own human environment and successfully use connections to achieve goals in life and business.

Without setting the task of turning the reader into a spy (although it might inspire someone!), the book's authors will help you learn to understand people and create long-term productive relationships. They will explain how to manage your own human "ecosystem," including:

- How to strategically build a network of contacts
- How to effectively establish and develop connections
- How to systematically raise your status in society
- How to quickly strengthen your position in a new organization
- How to create a circle of reliable friends and perhaps find a partner

# Preface. Intelligence Is Networking

## Why We Wrote This Book

Networking is the building of a social network, the use of connections to achieve success in life and career.

A spy is a professional networker. Finding new contacts and developing relationships is their primary job. This occupies most of a spy's time on a daily basis. Which means they must do this work correctly. And think strategically, planning every step. In such important and responsible work, it's impermissible to waste time and make mistakes.

In fact, networking is practically the only activity of spies—aside from, of course, cracking safes between sips of vodka martinis, if you believe the popular "movie versions" of their craft. First, spies constantly search for "sources"—that is, people. Second, they build relationships with people who represent interest to them. Preferably close relationships. So close that people are willing to share their most intimate secrets. At the same time, professional spies constantly work on their own development and advancement in society to enter circles where decisions are made. In this process, they develop extensive networks of contacts.

Spies are specially trained to study people. Over time, gaining experience, operative workers become magnificent practical psychologists. They can literally see right through people, and the ability to develop relationships becomes the most important of the skills they possess. They are likeable, friendly, convincing. As professional recruiters should be.

Unfortunately, even spies don't receive special training in strategic networking. Such a discipline still doesn't exist. Gradually, as a result of years of trial and error, each operative worker develops their own networking practice. Moreover, many don't even realize they have a strategy. Most don't think about networking in such categories.

We spent nearly a quarter century in service as illegal intelligence officers under deep cover, successfully working with people of many nationalities and carriers of different cultures. Behind us are many victories, but we didn't avoid mistakes either. Illegal work, during which we had to pass ourselves off as citizens of other countries, became invaluable experience for us. We built our networks of contacts from scratch: in four different countries, in three different languages. We had to create a fourth in our homeland, Russia, where we returned after a twenty-five-year absence. We came back to a country that had changed beyond recognition over a quarter century. Here we found ourselves without friends, "our own among strangers," speaking our native language with an accent.

This book is an attempt to share our networking experience. Although there are many books devoted to this topic, and some of them are really good, all these books can be divided into two groups. The first presents advice and recommendations that will help you gather contacts more quickly at various events and develop communication skills. Such skills are undoubtedly useful, but just as a general commanding an army doesn't necessarily need to be the best marksman, these skills alone won't necessarily help you build long-term, productive relationships with people, let alone teach you to strategically manage your network of contacts.

The second group of networking books consists of collections of various stories from the lives of people who've built successful careers as company executives or motivational speakers. Stories about how outstanding networkers achieved success are indeed motivating, but they're not very useful for people without off-the-charts egos who aren't spoiled by huge offices with crowds of subordinates. Moreover, most of the business realities and communication traditions that the authors of such books describe are unlikely to exist anywhere else besides the United States of America.

In our book, we wanted to look at networking through the eyes of intelligence professionals. We tried to make the book as close in spirit to a training manual as possible. We were guided by the desire to make our experience useful to the widest possible circle of readers.

A true professional in any craft is distinguished by having a system. Such a system goes beyond a set of best practices and life hacks. It has its own philosophy and includes a set of rules that make acquired experience reproducible. For example, if you study many books written by different writers, you'll discover certain rules of plot construction and character development that make novels successful.

Such networking rules, applied systematically and thoughtfully, even with fairly average execution, will enable any person to build a quite solid network of contacts, which, in turn, will help them achieve their set goals in life and business. True talent in networking can be multiplied by the systematic process that talented people often lack—just as an uncut diamond acquires value when a true master takes on its faceting.

At any mention of strategy, a natural question about the goal immediately arises. Admittedly, a spy doesn't engage in networking for fun. They face a whole series of operational tasks. For example, building trusting relationships with a specific person, which will require many intermediate steps. Or perhaps influencing some government organization. In any case, careful goal-setting plays a key role in any important matter. Without setting tasks, progress in networking cannot be measured and evaluated—that is, you'll never understand whether you've achieved excellence in this field or, as they say, contented yourself with easy prey.

The idea of writing a book and sharing our experience in networking as intelligence officers under deep cover is dictated by our desire to help readers use their personal connections to achieve important life goals. We sincerely hope that afterward, you too, in turn, will share your experience and successes with others...

## What We Will Tell You About

We'll begin with defining strategic networking as purposeful, professionally conceived social interaction of a person with their environment. In doing so, we'll consider networking as structured, systematic activity. Behind every system and strategy there's always a theory. To become more effective, people must understand why they do what they do. "There's nothing more practical than a good theory," as the famous psychologist Kurt Lewin said. That's precisely why we'll start our book with a brief overview of some aspects of the theory of personal social connections that we'll need later.

We'll explain what personal social networks are and how they function. This will give you the opportunity to map your own personal network and conduct a deep analysis of it. Once your network of contacts is schematically transferred to paper, you'll be able to clearly see your true place among the people around you, understand the strengths and weaknesses of your relationships. Then you'll be able to plan the steps necessary to expand your network, make it more productive, and raise your status in society.

Next, we'll proceed to setting networking tasks and discussing the subtleties of building relationships with people. We'll examine this process from the very beginning—from evaluating the person you'd like to meet and first contact with them, to building relationships and developing mutual understanding, trust, and friendship.

The book's content is designed to lead you from understanding the basic principles of networking to practical methods, and then to a strategy for developing relationships with your environment. We strived to present the planning process in networking as clearly as possible. This should help you thoughtfully set tasks and see progress in your daily work. The book also includes a series of step-by-step recommendations and templates that will help you hone your networking skills.

Then we'll rise to the next level of networking. If developing relationships with one person is essentially micro-networking, then interaction with a group of people or an entire organization can be called macro-networking. At this level, there are specific rules, workarounds, pitfalls, and best practices.

The results of your networking inevitably depend on your social status: the higher you are in the social hierarchy, the easier it is to attract people to you, the greater the "reach" of your network, the more opportunities you have. Ideally, you surely want interesting people to come to you themselves, rather than you chasing after them! To achieve this, you need to become an important, noticeable, in-demand person. In short, become a star!

We'll discuss how you can raise your social status, advance in organizations, become noticeable in society, and effectively interact in the social environment in which you find yourself. Since more and more communication is now moving into the virtual world, we'll also pay attention to your virtual connections and virtual status.

Your success in networking will most likely not come immediately. Practice will require effort—sometimes quite significant. But these twenty-five years of illegal work weren't easy for us either! At least you won't have to worry that your persistent, purposeful, and successful networking efforts will attract counterintelligence attention!

# Introduction. Networking from a Spy's Perspective

We humans are social creatures and constantly interact with other people. Moreover, most of the time we don't even pay attention to how and why we do this. Visiting relatives, meeting with friends, or chatting with a couple at the neighboring table in a cafe—this is all networking, an integral part of our life. You could say that as long as we live, we do nothing but constantly establish contacts.

But for some, networking is a source of income, the basis of existence. More precisely, their life and well-being depend on how well they can establish necessary contacts. Spies, politicians, diplomats, journalists, salespeople, and all those whose earnings and careers directly depend on communicating with other people will agree that networking requires a thoughtful, active approach. We'd like to focus on networking as a professional activity and strategic way of managing interpersonal interaction. This requires a special, systematic approach to your social activity.

Remember one saying? "He who doesn't plan his victory plans someone else's." Intelligence operatives are obsessed strategists. Work constantly forces them to think ahead. Would you really go to a dead drop with compromising microfilm or to a meeting with a valuable agent if you haven't mentally rehearsed all scenarios of possible developments beforehand? Conduct an important operation without thorough preparation?! Well, good luck to you! A spy uses a similar approach almost automatically when creating their network of contacts.

Let's start by debunking one common myth: strategic networking, contrary to popular opinion, is aimed not at all at acquiring a circle of friends. We're talking about developing a purposeful approach to relationships with those around you, about achieving life goals through creating and managing such relationships. Networking and friendship are certainly related things, but still different. And to be honest, close and reliable friends are merely a by-product that may arise as a result of networking.

Or may not arise. For example, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, four-time president of the United States and perhaps the chief "architect" of the world we live in after World War II, never had close friends in his entire life. He was known as a person who easily struck up relationships and just as easily exited them. Generally, he was calculating and vindictive. Which, however, didn't prevent him from perfectly mastering the art of managing people around him and influencing them. His entire history of ascending to the pinnacle of power was connected with strategic networking.

At the foundation of strategic networking lies a view of your place among others, so to speak, using a "bird's eye view." This allows you to consider your relationships with people, as well as all relationships around you, as a dynamic "ecosystem." Once you have a map of this ecosystem, you'll be able to consciously navigate it and manage its development, using your time and resources more meaningfully and effectively.

A clear example of the value of such a "view from above" is your daily commute from home to work and back. There are several ways to get from point A to point B. You can not overthink it and go the traditional route—that is, sit stuck in traffic on the main street, losing tons of time and nerves in the process. It's the same in networking: you can spend weeks unsuccessfully trying to get through to the secretary of a very important person whom you desperately need right now...
