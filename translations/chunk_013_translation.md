community of bicycle enthusiasts or tomato producers—with new large international networks for communication.

Second, you'll find yourself at the center of attention. People will be drawn to you by natural curiosity. You've probably heard about the attraction that the mysterious world of "bohemia" creates for influential politicians and businessmen. The most famous example of such attraction is the story of Mata Hari, a Dutch exotic dancer in Paris during World War I. She was accused of using her connections with high-ranking French officials for espionage in favor of the Germans. While Mata Hari's effectiveness as a spy was greatly exaggerated, the attraction of rich and influential people to the young artist was quite real.

To emphasize the advantage of creative personalities in networking, we'd like to cite as an example the Soviet illegal intelligence officer and talented architect Yuri Shevchenko. During the Cold War, working in Europe under the legend of an artist, he achieved remarkable results, receiving for his many years of work the highest state award—the title of Hero of Russia. During a certain period, he alone supplied up to a third of all NATO secret documents that Soviet intelligence possessed.

## Help Solve Important Problems

By responding to a recognized public need as an organizer or participant in projects important to the city or company, you gain recognition and respect. It's unlikely anyone would have noticed Swedish activist—schoolgirl Greta Thunberg—if people weren't concerned about the state of the environment.

In every city and every organization there are always problems causing disputes and attracting public interest. Issues of politics, environment, education, security, or city life always require someone to help solve them.

Mass media "feed" on these problems. Show activity, participate in public discussions—and you'll instantly become a valuable guest for reporters and interviewers whose work consists of constantly searching for content to fill the 24-hour news cycle every day. And if you move from words to action—say, organize cleaning of the local river—you can generally become a media hero.

Just be careful that the issue you take on doesn't cause negative emotions, isn't petty and situational, and doesn't create in others a feeling that you're promoting exclusively your personal interests. Many bloggers with millions of subscribers have earned quite a bit of money promoting their "brand" and all sorts of products. However, they often evoke more envy than admiration from subscribers. Your image in the media space should help create friends and allies, not just envious viewers.

If it seems you can't do this alone, find people or organizations dealing with issues that concern you and offer them help. We're confident—your investments of time and energy will soon give you the right to become one of their leaders.

## "A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss!"

One of the unusual ways to raise your status that we discovered for ourselves as spies is to constantly be "in motion." Both in the sense of travel and in the sense of making constant changes in your own life.

The benefits of travel are quite obvious. Flights, tourist trips, cruises, hotels in remote places—all this is amazing opportunities for meeting interesting people who also want new sensations. The personalities you meet on such trips are on average more dynamic, more communicative, and more successful in life. Exactly this type of people is needed as friends. If you work diligently on acquiring contacts during trips and their subsequent development, many of them may well become the next step in your career. It's not for nothing they say that "travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer." In terms of new friends and new opportunities—you certainly can't argue! During our work, we used, for example, vacations for travel to wine-producing regions—from France to California, South Africa, and Argentina, to meet with people whose profile was of interest to us. And an additional bonus was good wine!

Being in motion, in the sense of readiness to change location or take risks, is a necessary condition for raising your own status. Long stays in one place create a safe, comfortable emotional environment that gradually binds, entangles, constrains you, "freezing" your status in the company or society. After some time, no one around expects anything new and exciting from you anymore, no one shows their former interest in you. In people's consciousness, the opinion has formed that you are what you are, that you've already reached your "ceiling." As soon as "public opinion" about you is formed, you're inevitably stuck in this niche. That's precisely why successful managers try not to stay in one place for long: they want to move along an "ascending" trajectory.

As spies, we successfully used the principle of so-called "country-to-country jumps." Each country's elites have their own hierarchy—unspoken rules for determining status. While in the perception of who you are relative to others in elite circles, money plays a significant role, family connections and place in the media space are also important. As soon as your acquaintances learn about your origin, family and education, places where you worked, etc., they'll immediately mentally place you at a certain level and treat you accordingly. Violating the established order and pretending you occupy a higher social position is practically impossible. People won't assign you higher status until you achieve something significant to deserve it.

Nevertheless, a person who arrived from abroad, from another culture, and sometimes simply from another city, can "game the system." Their real social status, if it's not obvious from appearance and behavior, is difficult for their new environment to "decipher." The natural curiosity of the local public will give the stranger a temporary advantage. They'll be assigned higher status by default, at least until their real affairs show otherwise.

The famous Israeli spy Eli Cohen (1924-1965) was sent in 1960 by Mossad to perform a special assignment under the guise of a successful Syrian businessman. His goal was to collect intelligence among high-ranking Syrian politicians and military officials. Under the name Kamel Amin Thaabet, he went to Argentina and settled in the Syrian emigrant community. Living in Buenos Aires, he became close to a person who subsequently became president of Syria. Eventually Cohen moved to Damascus, where he was able to integrate into the upper layers of Syrian society. His "project" for creating a network of contacts consisted of holding parties at his home for high-ranking representatives of the Syrian political and business world. Eli Cohen never could have become admitted to the very closed circles of the Syrian elite if he hadn't come from a distant country.

# Chapter 8. Launching Operation "Network"

The time has come for decisive and active actions! Now you know what needs to be done to build your "ecosystem" of contacts and how to do it. However, as we warned at the very beginning, in networking it's more important not to know but to do. It will be simultaneously difficult and interesting for you. The goal of this chapter is to give you several more practical tips. They'll help you confidently hold to the planned course. Others will once again warn you against possible mistakes.

## Find Yourself a Coach

Everyone knows how difficult it sometimes is to force yourself to face daily problems and disappointments. That's precisely why we turn to fitness trainers, dietitians, and family counselors. The same applies to networking. Your plans may be simply ideal in their conception, but when it comes time to meet with someone after a long workday, you feel too tired to force yourself to execute them. And the people you meet, you don't interest much yet. Therefore, it may turn out that you feel disappointed and demotivated.

That's why at such moments there should be a person nearby to whom you can turn for help. You need a coach capable of listening to your problems, supporting and suggesting a solution. But what's even more important, you need someone who can ask difficult questions and make you think. Your coach should play the role of a kind of mirror in which you'll see yourself as you are. This is someone with whom you can discuss and think through your plans and actions. You can't improve and become better if you don't have an honest and objective view of yourself from the outside. Your coach can emphasize your shortcomings but at the same time motivate you for further actions. Try to find among your friends someone who can give you an honest and unbiased assessment. Not all close friends are capable of this. And since every person has their own judgments and "blind spots," having two such coaches is even better. Your long-term goal: surround yourself with trusted people who can help you progress not only as a networker but as a professional and simply as a person. And don't forget about your personal "advisory board"!

## Choose a Role Model

As social beings, we learn to behave correctly by imitating others. There's nothing bad or humiliating in the desire to follow someone else's example in striving to repeat and surpass someone else's achievements. Knowing we might be observed, with every step recorded and analyzed, we learned to imitate behavioral patterns characteristic of different peoples and cultures. Imagine you're crossing several borders with different passports. If you don't pay attention to how you behave and what you say, any careless gesture can give you away as quickly as an incorrect answer to a border guard. A good example is the catastrophic mistake of Michael Fassbender's character in Quentin Tarantino's film "Inglourious Basterds." He "blew his cover" when, posing as a German officer, he counted on his fingers in a way uncharacteristic for this nation...

Hence the advice: find a person you admire as a networker and leader, and analyze what qualities make them attractive to those around them. Observe how they interact with other people and try to imitate. And even better—try to connect with this person, ask for advice, and become friends with them.

## Learn to Motivate Yourself

A key component of your networking is motivation. As spies, we were in a privileged position—we were driven by a deep understanding of the importance of our work, our patriotic convictions, and our ambitions. We had no shortage of motivation. Facing difficulties and fatigue, we understood that we couldn't turn from the path and admit our inadequacy as officers and professionals. In ordinary life, everyone can find various excuses and pretexts. Many are accustomed to putting everything off "for later." After all, you can always find a reason to give yourself a break. We're not some kind of superhumans...

You should view efforts spent on networking not as expenses but as investments. Just as you invest your money, here you invest your time in a better future, in new opportunities that your contact network will later bring. In investments there's a law of accumulated interest: the more you reinvest, the larger the monetary base, the faster the sum accumulates in your account. The earlier you start investing, the more your savings will grow by retirement. The same law applies to networking: the earlier you start, the larger your network will be, the faster it will grow, and the larger it will ultimately become. Movement generates movement. People in the network themselves will bring you to new contacts without any special efforts on your part. Each new person multiplies your future opportunities, each new increment of social capital raises your status.

## Don't Be Afraid of Rejection

Another important skill in communication: try to curb your fear of being rejected. Prepare to calmly take blows. Someone definitely won't like you, and some may even unambiguously show you the door. For us, as spies, over the course of our career such cases accumulated more than enough. Making so-called "cold calls" is always unpleasant, but experience overcoming fear and awkwardness when communicating with completely unfamiliar people can't be replaced by anything, it's simply priceless. Remember the energetic young guys with badges and boxes who for a while went door to door, called apartments, and offered irons, kettles, and God knows what else? Many refused to communicate with them, but some agreed to buy the offered goods from them. Experienced people will confirm that precisely such sales experience gives a person excellent skills, toughens them. So don't be frightened: unpleasant work connected with communicating with various categories of the population will also help you overcome fear of public speaking.

On the very first day at business school, we were given a group exercise that seemed partly amusing and partly mocking. We had to go to a busy intersection and sell drinking water in plastic cups to pedestrians. In the center of a big city, we looked idiotically ridiculous then. But a child selling homemade lemonade in the same plastic cups wouldn't cause any rejection from the public.

The whole point is that children don't have an innate fear of embarrassment—they simply approach and ask about what they need. Fear of being rejected is imposed on us by society and various codes about what's "right" and what's not. Different cultures have their so-called "acceptable forms of behavior." For example, talking to a stranger on the street may look quite normal in the United States or Italy but will be disapproved of in Finland, Japan, or Russia. Moreover, if people reject your offer, you're unlikely to see them again—so what's the difference! Over time, when you have thousands of contacts and hundreds of rejections behind you, you'll acquire thick "elephant skin" and with it a philosophical attitude toward life.

## "Camouflage" Your Networking Among Other Affairs

But where to find time for everything? There's no "magic" recipe on this account. You can't allocate time for life and separately—for communication. It won't work that way. Networking will have to be made an organic part of your life. From our personal experience, learning networking is like studying a foreign language or playing the violin: to develop the skill, you must do this every day—sometimes just a few minutes, but daily.

Whatever you do, wherever you go—think about whom you can talk to, whom you can meet. And conversely: plan your activity—education, sports, walks, vacations—constantly thinking about networking goals. Take the schedule of events and affairs you're planning for the next month and write in networking work day by day: this way you'll better distribute your efforts and time. If you've divided people into priority groups, use free time—for example, when waiting for a doctor's appointment or a flight at the airport—to call by phone or write by email, put likes and comments. Compile an annual list of birthdays and, according to set priorities, plan visits, dinners, and buy gifts so that all this fits into other affairs and trips. Review the schedule of interesting events and conferences and optimize it for your networking strategy. Invite new acquaintances to train or travel together, simultaneously developing relationships. Hold parties for several friends at once and invite new acquaintances whose connections you want to strengthen. The more proactively you behave, the better you plan and organize—the more effectively you'll learn to use your own time.

## Keep a Diary

For a spy, keeping a diary would probably be the most foolish idea that could come to mind: for counterintelligence this would be a priceless treasure trove of information completely exposing all secret work.

However, a diary performs a most important function, especially necessary at initial stages of any new complex work—it excellently organizes thoughts, performing the role of a virtual interlocutor. In addition, leaving behind a chain of memory about events and thoughts, it, in the case of networking, allows you to return to meetings and conversations that happened earlier, "register" facts and emotions, and look at what happened from the height of accumulated experience.

From a purely practical point of view, your diary will become a repository of information about your contacts, and together with the calendar-planner that's part of every yearbook, it will help you, as we just discussed, better fit networking into the flow of your daily affairs. And your regular entries will be invaluable material for analyzing your forward movement!

## Periodic Analysis of Your Network

**Stage 1**

Looking at the picture of your contact network, ask yourself—how much does your network correspond to the challenges you face? What are your life goals for the next year or two? Where do you see yourself? To what degree do people in your network correspond to the goals you've set? Can they help you achieve what you're planning? With whom from your contacts do you spend most of your time? Is this the most effective use of your time? Do you have problems in relationships with anyone in your network? Mark the most important people and assess how contacts with them are developing. Mark relationships you want to fix.

**Stage 2**

Take a pen of another color, say red, and mark on your network picture those changes you'd like to implement. Who can help you and how to meet them? Where are the people from whom you'd like to learn? Can any of your current contacts introduce you to them? Mark those who could become mentors for you. Write down whom you want to meet. Look at whether any of your existing contacts can introduce you to them. Then take another sheet of paper and write an action plan for the next month.

**Stage 3**

At least once a month, set aside a sufficiently quiet hour in the evening to review your personal contact network. Assess how successfully you implemented your plan and what could be improved. Mark new acquaintances on the map. Analyze changes in relationships over the past month. Repeat stages 1 and 2. This should become a habit for you, become necessary routine. In six months you'll see yourself what amazing results you'll achieve in networking!
