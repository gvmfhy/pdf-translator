*[Continued from Chunk 7]*

it becomes clear, you'll either understand that the person has entered your Support Circle, or your relationship will gradually weaken. The fact is that friendly relationships aren't divided into "true" and "false." They simply belong to different functional circles and are based on different goals.

Strong relationships are built on the exchange of something valuable. People fear deepening relationships if they don't understand what you might demand of them in the future. At some point, you need to declare your "vision" for the relationship—that is, what you expect from your partner and what you can offer in return. This doesn't apply to the very first meetings, but don't postpone the issue for long—your acquaintance will want to clarify everything anyway. If they don't share your vision, let this become clear sooner rather than later.

Your "declaration of vision" doesn't necessarily have to be expressed in words. Through concrete actions you can convey the message much more effectively. You must constantly search for something valuable for your contacts and actively offer it. When people see that you bring something important to them into the relationship, they'll reciprocate.

Reciprocity is the sine qua non, the necessary condition of any strong relationship. If one party feels they're being taken for granted or as temporary, such a relationship awaits inevitable collapse. The "exchange currency" can be anything—from pleasant time spent together, friendly communication, access to exclusive clubs and mentorship to help with career advancement or access to investment opportunities. You can be confident that everything is fine in the relationship if you know exactly what you're exchanging with your partner and that this exchange is mutually beneficial.

## Three Parameters for Measuring Relationship Dynamics

How do you measure progress in relationships and monitor their dynamics? Track on your contact network map how a person moves from the Development Circle to the Productivity Circle, how the intensity of relationships grows, how they build connections with your friends. Thus, you can assess the stability of your connections and your real progress. Later in the book we'll offer some tools to help you do this. But for now, a bit of theory. Relationships are characterized by a number of parameters that describe what's happening between you and your acquaintance. Let's examine them in turn.

Leadership and dependence characterize the initiative and roles of the parties in interaction. If you initiate contact, it's quite natural to expect that at the first stage you'll find yourself in the position of managing the process. Any role reversal, for example when your contact begins to take initiative by suggesting going somewhere together or calling you first, speaks of interest in you and signifies progress. Relationships in which initiative and leadership remain asymmetric for a long time usually fail, except in cases when roles in the relationship are purely functional or when one person naturally dominates by virtue of their age and experience, for example in professor-student or employer-employee situations.

Communication flows in relationships are another element that needs careful monitoring. Low frequency of communication means the relationship base is unstable—the participants have little to talk about. More frequent communication covering a wide spectrum of topics, especially with increasingly noticeable signs of sincerity, spontaneity, and emotionality, is clear evidence of growing closeness. A good example of maximum communication level is interaction between spouses in a family.

The opposite dynamic, in which communication frequency decreases, should cause you concern: something is going wrong. Exceptions might be close friends or relatives living far from each other. During our intelligence career, we couldn't maintain regular contact with relatives for almost three decades, but they were ready to accept us with open arms at any time.

Emotional involvement and level of mutual trust are also very important parameters of human connections. As mutual understanding between people develops, they empathize and support each other more, demonstrate more emotional openness, more often exchange opinions not only on everyday interests but also on moral, religious, and philosophical questions.

On the scale of personal emotional involvement—the best indicator of the depth and quality of human connections—relationships vary from casual acquaintances and blind dates to lifelong friendship or love. Developing relationships, we strengthen our participation, involvement in another person's life. We not only reduce emotional distance but also expand the range of spheres in which we interact.

As a rule, as relationships deepen, the roles of its participants gradually develop and expand. Let's give a simple example. When you first meet someone, you clearly know what problem brought you together and what role each of you plays. You might be a buyer or seller, intern or trainer. But, for example, in marriage it's difficult to find an area of life that doesn't require your joint participation. You are simultaneously a relative, sexual and business partner...

## "Peaches," "Apples," and "Pomegranates"

The dynamics of relationship development can also vary depending on the nationality of the person you're dealing with. In the period of globalization in business circles, national traits are gradually being erased. However, despite the fact that typical behavior in relationships more often reflects social status than nationality, ethnic and national origin still matters. In the course of our work, we encountered three models of relationship development connected with national characteristics. Let's conditionally call them "peaches," "apples," and "pomegranates."

In the "peach" model, a person easily establishes first contact and willingly develops relationships to the level of a casual acquaintance that obligates nothing. However, then considerable effort and time are required to make them open up and gain trust. To the "touch," such a person resembles a peach: they're very soft, their skin and flesh are easy to pierce, but then you run into something very hard and impenetrable. Most Americans fit this model—they're very friendly and sociable, but at the same time incredible individualists carefully guarding their personal space.

Compared to American "peaches," Russians are more like "pomegranates." They converge with new people with far less enthusiasm, are reserved and cautious at initial stages of relationships. However, once the hard Russian "rind" is pierced, practically no corner will remain closed to you in their soul!

The French, like many other Europeans, usually fall somewhere between "peaches" and "pomegranates"—something like "apples." More reserved than Americans at the initial stage, they prefer not to rush until mutual understanding and trust mature. Nevertheless, some areas—just like apple seeds—will remain hidden and difficult to access.

Of course, the three models described are in pure form a product of our personal experience. Often the dominant role in relationship development is played by the character, motives, and origin of the people with whom you interact.

## How to Maintain Numerous Connections

The necessity of spending much time and emotional energy naturally limits the number of very close connections that can be effectively maintained. This becomes obvious as soon as you draw your functional circles. In the Development Circle, where more distant contacts are located, an ordinary person can have approximately 100 connections; in the Productivity Circle—up to 75 friends and colleagues. In the Support Circle, not counting family members, people rarely have more than three to five very close, intimate friends, not counting relatives. For professionals actively working with people—for example, spies, real estate agents, lawyers, or politicians—the number of connections in the first two circles may well turn out to be twice as many. Virtual contacts on Facebook or LinkedIn will add hundreds of new contacts to your network, but the level of your virtual interaction will remain within the same scheme: you'll still pay significant attention only to a small number of connections.

When you have a hundred people in your network, maintaining contact with them presents no particular difficulty. But what to do when the same politician has to think about thousands of contacts, with almost each of them considering him an important connection and, accordingly, expecting attention? And here once again comes to the fore one of the possibly hackneyed concepts of networking—prioritization. Not all relationships are equal. Their value rises and falls as your life changes, and with it—your tasks. Strategic networking returns us to the necessity of seeing your network from the "bird's eye view" height. This means you'll have to classify your relationships and compile several contact lists with varying degrees of priority.

The first list consists of key relationships on which your career, income, family stability, and most important future plans depend. People from this group deserve regular personal attention from you. That is, for them you must reserve on average one extended meeting at least once a quarter—preferably lunch or dinner—as well as meaningful gifts for birthdays and occasions when you visit them. Additionally, to properly maintain such relationships, you need to plan at least one phone call or electronic message per month, not counting "likes" on their social media posts.

The second list is the complete opposite of the first. It includes people whose relationships can, to put it in not entirely politically correct terms, be "frozen." Little happens in such relationships daily, but when necessary they're easy to revive. Here you can use all the power of virtual social networks. However, a couple of phone calls per year to exchange news and birthday greetings are still mandatory conditions for maintaining such relationships.

In the third list fall those who remained outside the first two—new acquaintances from studies or good friends to whom you feel indebted. Since such relationships are often in development mode, your approach will depend on the stage and purpose of each. Our experience suggests: to stabilize and strengthen established relationships, you'll need 2-3 meetings at which you need to raise issues substantial for each party—with subsequent regular calls and emails touching on the discussed topic as well as personal aspects and interests.

When people meet and friendly relationships develop between them, their communication happens regularly and often. People get used to each other and actively study one another. In their heads they reproduce images of each other, adapting their behavior to the new friend. Over time, mutual understanding strengthens, and time between meetings can increase. For proper maintenance of relationships at the development stage, from two meetings per month to one every two months may be required, depending on the dynamics of emotional involvement. Relationships that are already stable and sufficiently close will quite withstand longer breaks without losing their significance.

## Remote Networking

Years of travel and rich experience moving our "operative base" from one country to another gave us a global network spanning all continents. Maintaining relationships with people on the other end of the world has always been difficult, but in recent years modern means of communication have significantly facilitated this work.

We'd like to emphasize that networking in virtual space and networking in the real world are quite similar things, whatever anyone tells you. Online space is simply an extension of your real network, and the same approaches we've discussed are equally applicable to the latter. Currently used popular platforms and tools may change, but the dynamics of relationships between people and communities remain generally unchanged. From a purely technical point of view, using Myspace for building networks fundamentally doesn't differ from the functioning of such platforms as Instagram or WhatsApp. Therefore, let's focus better on methods and goals rather than tools that constantly change.

Over many years we've noticed that virtual relationships usually fall into the same three stable groups, depending on purpose, frequency of interaction, and emotional closeness. These online groups reflect our Functional Circles. The main thing is to recognize the type of interaction with a person online and coordinate your actions with the overall networking strategy.

The most intensive and close online interaction is usually "reserved" for members of your Support Circle. This happens almost daily. Here you usually have cohesive groups of friends conducting endless dialogue, for example, through group chat. The group is stable because all participants are aware of each other's daily lives. In this case, our personal social "filter" is inactive, and we feel we're part of a mutual "zone of trust." This is precisely how deep interpersonal relationships are cultivated on the internet.

The next type of interactive interaction imitates what happens within the Productivity Circle. These connections, as a rule, are quite purposeful and are maintained by mutually shared and clearly expressed interest. Examples might be book clubs, groups of music fans, auto forums, or even alumni pages. The common theme helps structure interaction and guarantees that everyone will find something interesting to discuss here. The activity of one or another participant may weaken over time, but it's always easy and simple for them to return to the general group. In such groups, excessively close relationships are rarely maintained, but this is a good way to establish regular interaction with other members. You may not even know many members of the online group personally, but they can become a good and reliable source of building connections and useful information.

One example of skillful use of thematic channels in virtual space is the case of Dickson Yeo, a doctoral candidate from Singapore who was apparently recruited by Chinese intelligence. He used his extensive LinkedIn connections to collect information from persons having connections with military and government officials in the United States. At trial, Yeo admitted that he contacted and negotiated with high-ranking officials, using a fake consulting company to post job listings and obtain needed information. With one of his numerous contacts, a US Air Force security specialist, Yeo maintained a five-year dialogue first through LinkedIn and then by phone, periodically requesting various consulting services.

Despite ultimately being detained, Yeo is a good example of how ubiquitous and effective online networks have become. Intelligence services can fully use virtual space if only because they know perfectly well: against the backdrop of millions of business contacts happening on the internet every minute, they can secretly and unhindered recruit new sources.

The third and least frequent case of online interaction is connected with those contacts you might have "frozen" for various reasons for some time: because of the great distance separating you or lack of direct need. Often these are contacts that perhaps were already in your Productivity Circle but gradually moved to its outer edge. You turn to them no more than a couple of times per year. We recommend compiling a list of contacts with whom you'd like to maintain contact and setting several "reminders" in your calendar to get in touch on time and remind them of yourself. It's useful to keep records of what was discussed last time to somehow demonstrate your care and interest in the other party. Fortunately, the task is made easier: you can review chat logs. Interaction at this level usually takes the form of a video or phone call or a long electronic message in which you can touch on important events that have occurred since the last contact.

Before the whole world went headlong into the internet, people used greeting cards in such cases, which they exchanged during holidays. In them they reported the latest significant events of their lives. In our case, the goal is not to let your contacts irrevocably "drift away." They should be close enough that you don't feel awkward if out of the blue you ask for some favor. Try to speak openly about personal matters or current problems—and you'll be surprised how easily they'll reciprocate. To compensate for the deficit in communication frequency, it's necessary to give your messages greater "depth," make them as open and personal as possible, if not "philosophical."

The simplest thing you can do on the internet or by phone is remind your friends that you're aware of important events in their lives, such as, for example, their birthdays or their children's birthdays. Modern technologies allow easy tracking of significant dates, but you yourself must pick up the phone or write something. No one will do this for you. A good first step might be birthday reminders on Facebook, but if you go a bit further, it's desirable to remember other important events in your circle's life. This will help you somehow stand out in other people's consciousness. For a serious networker, each such date provides an opportunity to attract people to themselves. If you diligently note facts from the family and professional life of your contacts, as well as their wishes and preferences that they share with you, you'll accumulate a mass of useful assets that can be used to create and strengthen positive attitudes toward yourself.

In the virtual world, the icon with your photo on various sites is the only image by which other people judge you. That's precisely why you should carefully think through creating the right profile on social networks. If it's difficult to discern your human qualities from it, understand what you like and don't like, if it seems made up and fake, people will reluctantly make contact and you'll miss the opportunity to transfer relationships from the virtual world to the real one.

It's easy to abuse virtual communications. Just one click—and your message is sent to hundreds of people. To you personally it may seem original and instructive, but it's possible that your friends are receiving this not for the first time. We're all swamped with hackneyed jokes, countless kitten photos, and copies of email correspondence between people we don't even know. So that your contacts don't unsubscribe and delete such correspondence due to wasted time, we recommend sending your virtual friends only those things they really need and find interesting. Don't forget the wise advice: treat others the same way you'd like to be treated yourself!

Currently everyone is dominated by the problem of personal "marketing." It's enough to look at the online profile of some "influencer" to understand how effective personal branding can become. We recommend you focus efforts on making your profile attractive to people you want to attract. Don't try to please everyone and everything. Given the incredible size of online space, we strongly recommend a more targeted approach. Once you establish yourself and your image, work on moving relationships from the Development Circle to the Productivity Circle. Soon you'll discover that your digital life becomes a useful continuation of everyday life. It will serve as a kind of multiplier of your usual networking efforts.

# Chapter 5. Methods for Strengthening Relationships

Now our discussion of building relationships moves from general, strategic principles to tactics and tools. What can be done to strengthen and deepen connections? As the person primarily interested in these relationships, you need to take initiative and determine what, where, and how should happen. You yourself are responsible for actions that will bring you closer to others. Below we'll offer some methods for strengthening relationships.

The essence of relationship development lies in the gradual erasure of barriers between people. The mentioned barriers are differences in emotional state, social position, lifestyle, origin, political views, and so on. As your connections strengthen and emotional involvement grows, such differences will have less and less influence on the stability of your relationships. If you want to develop relationships, you need to demonstrate that no differences will affect your friendship. And in most cases you won't be asked to betray your convictions: if you remain true to yourself, people will respect you even more.
