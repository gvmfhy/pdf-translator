## Network Density and Its Significance

One important concept is personal network density. It's calculated by dividing the total number of existing connections between people in the network by the number of all potential connections, and varies from 0 to 1. Simply put, if your network density equals "0," this means all your contacts are separated from each other and not connected to each other at all. Sales specialists, as a rule, have low-density networks because they have separate relationships with unconnected clients. If your network density equals "1," then everyone in it knows everyone else. This is quite typical for a study group or a team in a production workshop.

What can density tell us about a given person's network of contacts? Good or bad network density, as such, doesn't exist. Spies are forced to keep the density of their networks at a fairly low level to keep their information sources as far apart from each other as possible and thereby reduce risks of leaks and exposure. A low-density network is also ideal for sales specialists. However, for a department manager in a department store, such a network would already look questionable. In the latter case, it means that teamwork in the store is absent and the manager may not be aware of what's really happening in their department.

From a management perspective, network density is a very important concept. If a manager's network density is very high, this means they don't have many connections outside their organization. In other words, they're simply stewing in their own juice. Such a person should probably start asking themselves whether such a situation is favorable for their career growth. However, from a management perspective, very low density is also not the best option. If you don't have enough connections in your own organization, perhaps something is escaping you.

In a stable group, when people live and work together for long periods of time, the density of their network increases. Relationships in the group become closer, warmer. The level of emotional support and mutual commitment grows.

Having familiarized yourself with the concept of network density, we can now better understand the significance of the connections we see on the network map of our Thai student. Individual parts of her network in Thailand have greater density than others. The connections on the map show that at the university and at work, she's not a member of any particular group. Perhaps she'll be very lonely and uncomfortable in the United States. When a person is accepted as a full member of a community or group, the feeling that they're superfluous here, alien, gradually disappears.

## Three Levels of Relationships

The next concept concerns the distance and purpose of relationships between you and people in your network.

Place yourself mentally in the center of your network and imagine three concentric circles. We call them Functional Circles. The first, inner circle usually consists of closest friends and members of your family. These are the people you trust most. You can, as they say, pour your heart out to them when the occasion arises. You can turn to them in both joy and sorrow. They form your Support Circle. Unfortunately, when it comes to everyday concerns, to your work and career problems, people from the Support Circle can hardly help you. And all because you've already taken advantage of what they can offer you. All you can do with your Support Circle is maintain existing relationships so that at the right moment you can turn to these people again.

The next circle is usually more densely "populated." It contains the overwhelming majority of people with whom you deal in one way or another. We call it the Productivity Circle, because almost all your useful interactions, all work and social activity happen precisely there. The Productivity Circle helps you achieve results. You know everyone in the Productivity Circle fairly well, you've already formed stable connections with them, but this doesn't mean all these people are so close to you.

The positive point is as follows: to be useful to each other, people don't at all need to become close friends. You can't, and shouldn't, be on friendly terms with everyone. As the example of the same Franklin D. Roosevelt shows, this doesn't prevent a person from achieving even the most ambitious goals. And President Roosevelt isn't the only outstanding networker who didn't make close friends. Another prominent example is former U.S. President Barack Obama.

You'll be surprised how many wonderful things people you barely know can do for you. Especially if they see mutual interest in such communication and if you ask them correctly. Your goal for members of the Productivity Circle is to identify the most important relationships and make them strong and productive, bringing the corresponding people closer to yourself. For spies, the most intense work on "establishing" relationships happens precisely in this circle.

Beyond the outer boundaries of your Productivity Circle lies another area, the so-called Development Circle. Essentially, this is the "horizon" of your network, where new contacts appear. This area plays the role of a kind of bridge between your network of contacts and the rest of the world. New people can enter the Development Circle but then disappear if relationships don't become stable and purposeful. They can return there again if you make some efforts or if external circumstances change. A dual strategy applies to the Development Circle. On one hand, you need to fill it with new people, creating a continuous flow of additional contacts into your network. On the other hand, you must study new people who appear on the horizon of your network and move those who represent interest into the Productivity Circle.

## Three Main Rules of Networking

Let's move to the basic principles of networking. They're surprisingly simple. In fact, they can be reduced to three simple rules. Let's imagine that communication between people is a flow of electrical signals. You can view your network as a set of light bulbs connected to each other. Such connections form nodes. Some nodes can be small, connecting only a few bulbs. But some turn out huge—with hundreds, if not thousands, of connections. The same thing happens with human connections. Some of us easily establish many connections. You surely remember that among the people around you—at school or at work—extremely sociable people constantly appeared who always had an extensive circle of friends and who were always in the center of attention. Let's call them "connectors." Every such person's birthday was always packed. By their nature, such people always attract attention; others are drawn to them.

**The first rule of networking:** discern, seek out "connectors" around you and build close connections with them. By getting close to them, you gain access to parts of their own networks, including those people you wouldn't have had the slightest chance to meet personally.

What are relationships? Essentially, an exchange process. This can be an exchange of goods, emotions, or information. In fact, every conversation is also an exchange, at least an exchange of attention to each other. When people offer you something, they expect something in return.

To offer someone something, no matter what exactly, you must have it—for example, money, information, or something else. Where to get this "something" for exchange with others? Most often—from those members of your network who have access to it, whether professional knowledge of stock markets or tickets to the Bolshoi Theater. It turns out that in this scheme, you're like a broker who produces nothing themselves but still contributes by facilitating the process of concluding a profitable deal.

In your network—if we again use the analogy with an electrical circuit—there are people who accumulate within themselves a lot of "something useful" that flows around. Let's call them "capacitors." Usually these are quite respected people. Others constantly turn to them for advice. In organizations, they possess institutional memory. If you find such "capacitors" and competently build relationships with them, they'll be able sooner or later to share their "accumulations" with you. As soon as you get something to share, you'll have the opportunity to exchange with people in your network. Using what you've acquired as a kind of currency, you'll be able to raise your status or exchange it for what you need. For a spy, the search for such "capacitors" who could become information sources constitutes the most important part of the work.

From the above follows **the second rule of networking:** identify "capacitors" around you and establish close connections with them.

In our imaginary electrical circuit, there are some elements that can disrupt or amplify energy transmission—"breakers" and "conductors." In social networks, these are "gatekeepers" (doorkeepers) or, conversely, "bridges"—that is, people who can put obstacles in your path or, conversely, open new doors. For example, your boss's secretary, depending on the quality of your relationship with her, can play the role of either "gatekeeper" or "bridge." If your relationship isn't great, her likely answer to your request for a meeting will sound like this: "You know, he's so busy right now. Maybe next week..." And, conversely, if you have a good relationship and you urgently need to see the boss, she'll answer: "Okay, I'll call back now."

People who give you access to other networks, organizations, or countries can also act as "bridges." Do you have, for example, friends from Brazil? If not and you suddenly need to fly there, you'll most likely find yourself alone in a country that may initially make you feel insecure. However, if you have a friend from Brazil—essentially your "bridge"—then she or he with the help of a couple of emails or phone calls can easily mobilize their local connections. And then you'll get the most pleasant and unforgettable impressions from your trip!

All this leads us to **the third rule of networking:** identify people who will perform the role of "gatekeepers" and "bridges," establish relationships with them so that they work for you, not against you.

Let's summarize. Very briefly, for networking it's important to acquire "connectors" and "capacitors," as well as establish relationships with "gatekeepers" and "bridges."

## How to Draw a Map of Your Network

Now, armed with theory, it's time to get to action and draw a map of your network. American writer Mark Twain once said: "The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one." The first steps in creating a map of your network will be the most difficult. That's why we want to explain them as simply and clearly as possible. Remember: strategic networking begins with strategy, and your strategy begins with building a map of your current network. Let's do everything in stages, step by step.

**Stage 1**
Take a large sheet of white paper and place a dot in the center. This dot is you. Then draw two circles around the dot. The first small, and the second larger, so that between the circumference and the edges of the sheet there's about ten centimeters. These are your Functional Circles. The first, as you remember, is the Support Circle—your relatives and closest friends. The second is the Productivity Circle, in which the majority of your stable connections will end up. The area beyond this circle will be your Development Circle—the horizon of your network, where new contacts appear. Draw radii from the center to the edges of the sheet. These lines form sectors—some larger, some smaller—that represent areas of your life, such as the office, your clients, educational institution, or leisure activity—those areas that correspond to your relationships.

**Stage 2**
Let's start placing our connections on the map: one person—one dot. If a person is important to you, make the dot bigger, fatter. You can use your smartphone contact list as a database. Decide for yourself how many people you want to place on the map. Stick to a reasonable approach: hundreds of people's phone numbers are usually recorded in a smartphone, but you don't need those you barely know and in whom you don't feel particular interest. Try to mark each dot with names or initials.

**Stage 3**
Then you can draw lines between you and other people that will reflect the nature of your relationships. To make the picture legible, mark only important contacts. If these are very intense relationships, choose a thick line. For sporadic relationships, use a dotted line. You can draw arrows on the lines to indicate who usually takes initiative. If initiative is mutual, arrows can be multidirectional. In exactly the same way—with lines and arrows—you can connect people in the network who know each other.

As soon as all connections are plotted on the map, think about how to indicate their quality. Pluses can represent positive, dynamic relationships, minuses—relationships with which you're experiencing some problems. And finally, highlight groups in your network that are connected by a particular interest with color. And voilà! You're almost done!

Although no! Not quite yet... In the end, it may turn out that some sectors or rings are too small to accommodate all the people you'd like to "stuff" in there, and some are almost empty. Although the basic principles of building a network are simple and intuitive, you may need several attempts and a bunch of wasted paper before you finally arrive at a more or less satisfactory variant that correctly reflects reality.

Don't worry, we warned you: it will take several attempts! Our suggestion to draw a network with circles, lines, and dots is just a recommendation. Don't rush and try to draw a clear and comprehensible map. If it works out—great! If not—don't despair and find another way for yourself. And remember—your network will change and the contact map will need to be corrected from time to time.

# Chapter 2. Networking Strategy

We hope you now understand how social networks function. It's time to delve deeper into the topic to reveal important ideas and introduce you to the most optimal methods. Developing a network of contacts is what we—consciously or unconsciously—do every day. Although how we do this depends on our personal qualities and lifestyle, there are still some "standard" skills that need to be improved in order to generally comprehend the networking process.

It may seem that the fairly specific networking methods we used as spies working under deep cover are inapplicable, for example, in the career of a beginning actor or financial analyst. In reality, universal networking mechanisms can be adopted by any person, regardless of age, profession, or nationality. It's just that spies tend to act somewhat more decisively and with greater emphasis on specific operative results.

As soon as you apply the "bird's eye view" described earlier to your contacts, you'll almost immediately discover problems and shortcomings of your personal network, such as low speed of acquiring new contacts, marking time in developing relationships with some people, or insufficient coverage. Considering various problems we encountered from time to time during our work as operative workers, we came to the conclusion that most of them are common to all and require fairly standard actions. If you learn to recognize them, you'll eliminate the overwhelming majority of obstacles in relationships, which will significantly improve your personal and professional life.

Based on our experience, typical difficulties are as follows:
• Setting adequate networking goals
• Building a networking strategy
• Acquiring new contacts
• Developing productive relationships
• Fixing problems in relationships
• Strengthening influence in groups and organizations
• Raising social status among those around you

In subsequent chapters, we'll describe how to overcome all these difficulties.

## From Life Goals to Networking Priorities

Many years ago, we, beginning spies, arrived in the country of our first foreign assignment. However much we wanted to gather useful information and quickly achieve results, we felt an acute need for emotional support. Around us there were no relatives or friends. Worse still, we had no social status that would support our self-esteem and make us significant partners for others. Our low, practically zero, social status didn't allow us to actively establish connections with interesting people, so necessary for intelligence work. In addition, it was necessary to build relationships with our immediate environment to try on and adopt local behavioral norms and customs. In other words, we needed a Support Circle. Over time, we established connections with neighbors, doctors, librarians, store and restaurant owners, local parishioners and clergy. After several sessions with a chiropractor—by the way, our peer—we struck up a friendly relationship with him. It lasted several years—until we had to move to another city. Interest in singing and music led one of us to a church choir.
