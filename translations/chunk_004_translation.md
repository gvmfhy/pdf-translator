*[Continued from Chunk 3]*

As a result, we gained not only the opportunity to spend time with pleasant people but also to establish important contacts with the local priest.

As we gained experience and confidence, our networking priorities shifted toward developing effective "cover" and acquiring higher social status. And then, when several years later our two sons were born, we discovered a completely new chapter in networking—the amazing world of parent relationships—on playgrounds and at school. In the following ten years, a completely different life opened up for us, a different network of contacts, different priorities. We established connections with many people in many countries, shared common interests, and interacted with representatives of different strata. Behind us were important professional achievements that gave us confidence to move forward, to break through to the higher echelons of society.

Finally, when at the end of a career in intelligence stretched over more than twenty years, we faced unexpected betrayal and arrest, our networking goals shifted to new priorities—recreating a circle of connections in Russia, where we returned with the whole family. Our path shows that every person has to rebuild their network of contacts and surround themselves with new people every time they themselves change and the circumstances of their life change.

Whatever the current needs in networking, they're determined by life goals as well as immediate priorities. It's impossible to overestimate how important correct goal-setting is for success. Without clear priorities, your interactions will inevitably turn into unpleasant, direction-less, aimless bustle that takes time and drains you emotionally—with extremely low returns. However, as soon as goals are set, your networking strategy immediately acquires meaning.

## Circle of Goals

A more complex method of goal-setting requires revising your long-term life plans. To successfully transform your goals into strategy, you need to answer the question of what specific steps will help lead you to achieving your goal. Whatever ideas and desires you possess, making them concrete enough to guide your networking is a quite serious task. To facilitate this task, we developed a simple scheme. And we used it every time we felt we needed to pause and reconsider our priorities.

On a sheet of paper, draw three concentric circles in the center. From center to edge, call them "What," "Who/Where," and "How." We recommend dividing the circles with radial lines into four sectors. The sectors will help you focus on various aspects of life and career—for example, Finances, Health, Family Life, Interests, or Personal Growth.

In each thematic sector of the central circle, write down one to three main goals you've set for yourself—for example, "have more friends," "earn more," "become a more interesting person," or "improve relationship with daughter."

Remember those who can provide help in achieving each of your goals or on whom their achievement may depend. In the next circle, opposite the goal "earn more," write in the names of people who can potentially help with this. Similarly, opposite the goal "become a more interesting person," write in the names of people you know or would like to know and who can participate in your personal and professional growth. If you can't immediately remember the names of the right people, write down where such people can be found—for example, in some professional association.

In the outer circle, opposite the name or place, write a short answer to the question of how you intend to build relationships with the right people and who can connect you with them.

Writing down problems and setting short-term and long-term goals helps systematize your thoughts. Regardless of how accurate or detailed the initial answers may turn out to be, every time you return to the circle and try to answer the questions, you improve your ability to achieve set goals.

## Assess Your Resources

As soon as you've determined your goals, proceed to analyzing the people you know. Copy your phone contact list and distribute people into groups such as family and family friends, former classmates, work colleagues, as well as people you meet at sports facilities or during other events.

Using knowledge of networking theory, find those who can act as "connectors" and "capacitors" in your network of contacts. Identify "gatekeepers" and those who will become a "bridge" for you, paving the way to other people or organizations. This will help distribute contacts by priority and usefulness for further development, as well as highlight those who are potentially capable of connecting you with other needed people.

If you feel that your main problem in networking is creating new contacts, give priority attention to building relationships with "connectors." Along with some of their contacts, you'll acquire new opportunities as well. Besides people who act as "connectors" due to some personal qualities, there are also those who are such by virtue of professional activity. Take a closer look at journalists, politicians, public relations specialists, bloggers, lawyers, lobbyists, charity fundraisers, recruiters, and HR managers you encounter from time to time—all these people must definitely enter your priority contact list!

"Capacitors," in addition to providing some valuable advice, are also capable of connecting you with many useful people. University professors, bankers, museum curators, art gallery owners, writers, and artists usually always attract interesting people who are already part of certain power structures or strive to be as close to them as possible.

If it's still difficult for you to approach certain organizations, remember the "bridges" you need to build there. As soon as you establish a reliable connection with a representative of a particular professional group—say, with some doctor—expanding contacts within this group will be much easier, and you'll be directed from one person to another.

In the process of building a network of contacts, you'll meet people with whom you'll definitely want to become friends, regardless of what roles they might play—simply because you like them.

And finally, don't forget about your "frozen" contacts—friends with whom you haven't communicated for some time. Usually these are people with whom you went to school together or worked. But these can also be people from other time periods of your life. Resume communication, ask them about work, about what has changed in their lives, and then regularly remind them of yourself. Become a member of alumni associations of schools where you studied, show activity. For example, for one of us, diplomas from several authoritative universities in different countries, including Harvard University in the USA, opened many "doors" around the world and gave significant impetus in forming a circle of friends.

## Pipeline of Contact Opportunities

For a spy, establishing contacts is daily, in a way even "routine" work. Their Development Circle must be constantly filled. To become a true networking professional, you must view all interactions as a pipeline of opportunities for developing new relationships.

Expanding your network of contacts, you'll inevitably be obliged to exit your comfort zone. In intelligence, inability to work outside your comfort zone means professional unsuitability. A spy must find common language with any person. Like many other skills, the ability to work effectively beyond your usual communication environment is acquired and perfected through practice.

When it comes to expanding contact opportunities beyond your usual environment, you'll face two main challenges. The first is connected with the growing isolation of our everyday relationships within comfortable groups, despite the giant opportunities provided by communication means. Incidentally, virtual social network platforms have exacerbated this problem. They've facilitated building enclaves in internet space for social and professional groups that enclose a person in a shell of established contacts with people who hold similar views and life positions. Anyone who doesn't share the group's dominant opinion quickly becomes an outsider who has no place among "our own," "correct" people.

If you want to expand your network of contacts beyond its current limits, be prepared to discover new places and social circles for yourself, break through the barriers of professional groups. You'll have to accept that overcoming such barriers can be painful, and gaining recognition in circles unfamiliar to you may require considerable time.

The other challenge is connected with the necessity of establishing relationships with people located higher than you on the social ladder. High social status usually comes with age. Each generation carries its own history, its own "code words," its own jokes and its own idols. To talk on equal terms with a person who is twenty or even more years older, and often much richer too, requires courage. To interest such a person in yourself requires certain talent. And for you to occupy a permanent place as a friend in such a person's life, you'll have to find such common interests for which age and social position don't matter. The constant search for this "common ground" that reduces social distance is the essence of "networking upward."

There's a category of people for whom it's easier than for others to build relationships with high-status people—these are journalists and people of the arts. Their professions provide opportunities for direct access to celebrities. Some even become their partners or lovers. It's worth recalling Camille Claudel, the student and then lover of the great French sculptor Auguste Rodin, or Paula Broadwell, who wrote a biography of American General David Petraeus. The technique of "networking upward" is based on the fact that with age and status, people prefer to give rather than receive. Sincere interest in their experience can help you find approaches even to persons who seem unattainable. Such networking requires creativity and courage, but it also develops creativity and courage. Therefore, don't be afraid to try—even failure will enrich you with priceless experience.

Your strategy for building a pipeline of contact opportunities should be twofold. First, ask your friends to introduce you to their acquaintances. Now you understand why you need the "connectors" we talked about earlier. And by the way, don't forget to thank them for their services!

Second, more often visit places where you can meet new people, participate more actively in various events, clubs, and online groups. Your constant occupation should be searching for places and events where you can meet interesting people. As a networker, you should compile and periodically update a list of such places. Keep statistics of your contacts to understand which of the places and events you visit give the best opportunities for meeting people.

## Those Terrible 30%

At first glance, it seems simple enough. But not everything is so good and smooth. We're talking about the so-called "30% rule." It turns out that if you don't make additional efforts, you'll most likely lose up to 30% of people in your network of contacts annually. Some of your acquaintances will leave the city, get married, or simply forget about you; others will break off relationships for some other reasons. And so on. Such a proportion of losses is fair not only for ordinary people but also for spies, who, considering the large influx in their networks, often refuse many opportunities that don't seem particularly promising. The "30% rule" means that to simply maintain the existing number of connections, you need to develop up to 30% of the total number of contacts annually. Frankly speaking, this is no easy task!

---

## "Wholesale" Networking

To compensate for the inevitable loss of the mentioned 30%, you need to find a way to quickly acquire many good contacts. For example, the position of head of an interesting project is an excellent opportunity to legally and purposefully build connections with a large number of new people in a short period of time. We call this "wholesale" networking. Participate in as many projects or events as possible that unite large groups of people.

Don't see such opportunities or projects around you yet? Try applying a creative approach: come up with something yourself! By the word "project" we mean any idea that makes people unite—from political discussion groups to running enthusiast clubs. Any such project will contribute not only to developing your network but also to your own professional and personal growth!

Such undertakings usually carry a pleasant bonus—meeting interesting and important people. Here, by the way, is an example from our own experience: the desire to expand the network to the highest decision-making circles led us to open a software development company in the USA. We later continued this activity in Russia as well.

## From Quantity to Quality

Don't get the impression that the main thing in networking is increasing the number of contacts. At some point, your network will reach such a size that adding more and more new people will simply become meaningless. You won't have time to properly manage relationships with all your numerous contacts. You'll need to focus primarily on improving the quality of your network. For a spy, network quality is more important than its quantity. The "Pareto Principle" applies to intelligence too: 80% of intelligence work results will be obtained from less than 20% of available contacts—the most valuable sources. The quality question will return you to the fundamental problem—distributing contacts by priority. You need to decide which of them you need most and why. This will also force you to filter contacts and remove from the network those that don't "work." Actually, this is exactly what, for example, sales managers do.

The same can be said about the quality of your relationships. At the very beginning of life together, when you and your partner are adapting to each other, you may encounter some tension in the relationship. Approximately the same "adjustment" happens with people entering your network of acquaintances. Aimless connections leaving ambiguity and misunderstanding will drain your energy and ultimately let you down at the most necessary moment when you're counting on them. Regular analysis and cleansing of your relationships, weeding out non-working connections will save you from many problems and unnecessary headaches.

If you want to become a successful networker, you need to think strategically, become purposeful and effective. You need to understand which relationships bring you closer to life and business goals, and invest in their development first. To improve the quality of your network, you must clearly imagine the underpinnings of relationships with each contact. "Rejecting" useless or unhealthy relationships may seem cynical, but in reality we do this constantly, consciously or unconsciously. By letting go of relationships that don't work, you avoid potential disappointments and open opportunities for new, more useful and promising contacts.

## Creating "Dossiers" on Your "Development Targets"

To ensure networking success, you must learn as much as possible about your contacts: about their lifestyle, characters, and motivations. In the professional jargon we used, there was such a word—"objektívka." It implies a brief report about a particular person. This can be anyone—from a foreign state minister arriving to discuss an important treaty to a subject under police surveillance. Usually, when our minister is going to negotiate with his colleague, intelligence provides him with two documents—one describing the supposed negotiating position of his counterparty, and another—with information about the opponent's personal character, his strengths and weaknesses—from testimony of diplomats who negotiated with him before, to what coffee he prefers, how many children and pets he has, and what he calls his mistress. Not surprisingly, the second document is often much more curious and in demand than the first.

The same need to understand who is before you applies to any of your potential contacts. You can't truly develop a relationship if you're not interested in what kind of person this is and what their needs are. Sincere curiosity, the desire to understand your acquaintance's way of thinking, their actions—all this remains the most reliable guarantee of developing a relationship with them. Such genuine interest on your part will be automatically read by the person's emotional sensors, ensuring agreement and reciprocity. The more facts about a person you learn, the better you'll understand their character, needs, and motives. That's precisely why, especially in the early stages of relationships, it's necessary to collect a "skeleton of facts" about your "target." Without such a "skeleton" of facts, it's often difficult to correctly interpret someone's behavior. Imagine that at a party you organized, a new contact pays too much attention to the fair sex. You'll form quite polarized opinions about the person, depending on information about whether they're married or not.

Collecting information about your contacts should become a constant routine. Try to build a mental "model" of the person and understand what drives them in life, what makes them happy or angry, whom they love and whom they can't stand, what's happening at their work, and much more of what determines their actions. An invitation to visit, visiting your interlocutor's home, or meeting their family will be especially productive from the point of view of collecting priceless facts that will help you understand them better.
