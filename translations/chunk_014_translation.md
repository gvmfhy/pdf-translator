*[Continued from Chunk 13]*

## Respect Personal Space and Others' Time

Throughout most of the book, we've introduced you to networking by teaching skills and strategies for achieving success. However, like any honest teacher, it's important for us to transmit not only knowledge but also wisdom accumulated from our own mistakes. Thus, our conversation won't be finished until we pay attention to the ethics of networking and problems we ourselves have encountered.

Networking is, first of all, social activity. In addition to the general desire to be a good person, you must respect others and take into account what influence your actions have on other people and the surrounding world.

Everyone has encountered people in life who torment others and accept no refusals. Don't become one of them. For a professional, such behavior is a sure path to failure. As we've already said, in relationships with other people, spies must be "gardeners," not "hunters." If you want relationships to flourish, you must respect others' personal space and private life. Encroaching on other people's private lives or disrespecting boundaries they themselves establish is one of the fastest ways to fundamentally destroy emerging relationships. Worse, reviews of your aggressive tactics will spoil future relationships with other people. Moreover, this will happen in absentia, without your knowledge.

In addition, you must remember the limited attention people can spend on you. Everyone has something happening in their lives, and in most cases you won't be in first place for others. Don't demand too much from your friends and acquaintances. In addition to the limited time they can devote to you, people also have emotional and empathetic limitations. It's not for nothing they say that "sharing a problem is half solving it" (well, or more in Russian: "one head is good, but two are better"). However, don't expect other people to bend over backwards for you. There's a fine line between positive support and emotional dependence. Respect the fact that, however much most people want to help you, each of them has their own life and limited capabilities for caring about others.

Friendship can be built, but it can't be imposed. What's most obvious in romantic relationships is quite applicable to all interpersonal connections as well. Having seen a clear signal that a person doesn't wish to deepen relationships with you, you must accept everything as it is and stop any attempts to change this. As we've already said, you must always have a virtual GoPro camera with you. If these people eventually change their minds, they'll return to you themselves. As a good networker, you must have a plan "B" in reserve so that no, even the most painful, rejection becomes an insurmountable obstacle in achieving your life goals.

We'd like to remind you about the risks that close relationships entail. It's no secret that often the most terrible and bloody showdowns happen within families and between the closest friends. The reason here is quite simple: when we trust someone, we thereby give them the opportunity to hurt us where we're most vulnerable. You must always be attentive to your actions toward the closest people. As spies, we put our lives on the line by trusting our Service, colleagues, and compatriots. The same tension exists, albeit at a less fatal level, between all close relationships, whether in business or personal life. You must do everything possible to maintain others' trust and never use information shared with you "in secret" to hurt or threaten those around you.

And the last thing we'd like to mention is the importance of observing boundaries. Networking isn't a game, and people aren't tools. We can't give you a complete and exhaustive list of what's ethical and what's not. You must figure this out yourself and establish your own boundaries. Most importantly—you must be able to recognize these boundaries before you reach them. If you don't do this, you'll find yourself on a slippery slope where you'll have to justify every action that can become increasingly unethical and self-destructive.

## Don't Try to Manipulate People

As you master networking techniques to perfection and gain experience in productive communication with different people, you may be tempted to use your abilities to make others do something useful for you against their own will. Even if you're pursuing the most noble and righteous goals, on this path there's always a probability of falling into an ethical trap, especially when using unacceptable means to achieve them. Many highly effective methods of managing interpersonal relationships may turn out to be not entirely ethical. Such means are often resorted to by swindlers, aggressive partners, and criminals. Suppress in yourself the desire to apply such methods if it suddenly appears. In addition to being unethical, these methods will most likely harm you greatly in the long run. After all, your task is to strategically build healthy, productive relationships, not twist others' arms through emotional pressure or coercion.

In practice, such methods most often are based on false or misleading information in which an ordinary person won't find anything suspicious. In the sphere of information warfare, such methods are called "social engineering." Leaders of religious sects, pimps, and swindlers use various psychological techniques to control their victims. Without going into details of forbidden methods, we'll point out one characteristic feature: they're based on a stronger emotional reaction to help than to pain, even if both come from the same person.

An aggressive partner will first cause harm and agonizing experiences to their victims, then turn everything around and offer emotional support. Despite the fact that such emotional "swings" are a source of troubles and misfortunes, they turn out to be a highly effective means of creating emotional dependence and evoke in victims a desire to prove they're worthy of the attacker. Under no circumstances should you apply such methods or anything similar to get close to people, much less control them. Instead of using other people's weaknesses, you should focus on their strengths and build close relationships on the positive. Fear may seem like an effective tool, but it's a short-lived means and, in essence, a double-edged sword. In intelligence, fear is the very last resort that can be used only once.

## Learn to Forget and Forgive

It's important to achieve your goals. But not at any cost. You build your network to improve the quality of your life, not to prove something to someone. Including not to endlessly expand your network or chase after some landmark contact. As professionals, we've had to think more than once about the meaning of networking. At the beginning of our career, an official came into our field of vision from whose opportunities and connections we, as intelligence officers, literally "salivated." We were at a distance of "one handshake" from this person and, as the rules required, prepared for our leadership at "Headquarters" a detailed plan for approaching the official. The answer from "Headquarters" literally shocked us. "Leave him alone," the cipher read, "you're not yet capable of working with such a connection." Upset and disappointed, we tried to argue, but to no avail. A year or two later, during a secret meeting with one of our operative supervisors, we again raised the question about the official. "Well look, guys," we heard in response, "we track a huge number of contacts of your colleagues around the world. We see what works and what doesn't. We keep statistics on contacts, including yours. Even if you managed to establish this contact, you wouldn't be able to maintain it. You'd have nothing to offer a person of such high level. Your contact would stall, and its loss would put an end to the possibility of reaching this person again in the future when you're ready for it." In other words—don't bite off more than you can chew...

The rich practical experience of intelligence service leaders once again emphasizes the thesis we're developing in this book: networking and social status go hand in hand, they're two sides of the same coin. Accumulating an increasing number of connections that add nothing to your social position and don't solve your problems makes no sense. In the end, everything is decided by the quality of your relationships. And to ensure the effectiveness expected of you by your friends and colleagues, you'll have to make efforts to become increasingly informed, resourceful, and attractive.

In a word, the better you become, the better your network becomes. As your value to others grows and new opportunities open before you, an increasingly high level of connections becomes available to you.

Networking, like politics, is "the art of the possible." This is about what we're really capable of doing. Not everything depends on us. Some relationships will inevitably turn out problematic. Some of those you consider friends will suddenly start plotting intrigues and spreading gossip about you. Someone will borrow from you and then stop answering your calls. Unfortunately, humanity is still far from ideal. All we can do is fulfill our own promises in hope that others will do the same. In relationships between people, there will always remain something of a lottery—sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. However—attention! If the same problems in relationships arise again and again, this is a reason to turn your gaze to yourself: maybe you yourself missed something...

And sometimes it's worth simply turning the page and moving forward. Preserving the health of your ecosystem of connections is much more important than trying at any cost to preserve some of them, even the most prestigious. There are no irreplaceable people. Don't take offenses too close to heart. Don't hold onto problematic relationships. Never try to take revenge. Don't waste your time and energy in vain—move forward. In strategic networking, good mood and motivation are your main assets. After all, you have more important things to do!

# Conclusion. Networking as Self-Improvement

Perhaps the main thing our intelligence work taught us is to be proactive. We had no other choice but to ourselves manage everything that happens around us, especially our connections. Our path to the goal implied that every movement of ours, every contact had to have meaning and a plan. As operative workers, we automatically became designers and builders of our human environment. Time after time, step by step, we surrounded ourselves with the people we needed. The goals of our work with people could be different, but in all cases we used a proven set of methods.

Just like spies, you can manage your own human "ecosystem." It's in your power to make the networking process purposeful and effective. For raising your social status, there's a set of understandable and proven rules. However, there's one important condition: you must be ready to make serious efforts.

People value the quality of things that surround them. Agree, it's not all the same to us where we live and what objects are in our homes. However, our human environment influences the quality of our lives incomparably more than ordinary things. Our successes and even our happiness depend on how much the people around us correspond to our character and our goals. But often we're ready to accept our environment as it spontaneously developed, not trying to get rid of the problems embedded in it. We allow people around us to determine our fate, forgetting about our own tools for influencing this environment.

But there's one exception! We're very attentive to choosing our life partners—our spouses. We dream of a person with certain appearance and character, we search for them, build relationships with them, love them, and care for them for many years. We won't agree to make a choice of spouse blindly, understanding how much they will influence our life. And even with all this attention, it happens that we make mistakes in choice.

And what about all the other people surrounding us? Distracted by daily trifles, we forget about our closest friends. We allow discontent and conflicts to spoil relationships and sometimes corrode us from within. We're lazy to make new acquaintances, missing excellent opportunities.

We wrote this book with the goal of convincing our readers that each of them can build their own human "ecosystem," organized according to their own standards, using methods of strategic networking. We urge our readers to abandon a passive, random, thoughtless attitude toward their contacts. Instead, we strongly advise everyone to invest time and efforts in a network consisting of people you value and respect.

Try applying the techniques of strategic networking described in this book. After all, there's nothing mystical or inexplicable in strengthening your social status—it's an understandable step-by-step process accessible not only to unique geniuses of networking like David Rockefeller, Klaus Schwab, or Richard Sorge. We ourselves have gone through this path several times and are confident it's within your power too.

As a proactive, strategic networker, you'll have the privilege of purposefully filling your environment with people you need and who are pleasant to you. You'll be able to choose with whom it's better for you to work to make your life more interesting or your business more successful. As you develop contacts and your "ecosystem" becomes ever more extensive, you'll have the freedom to "disconnect" from those who bring you only pain and problems. With a large network of contacts, you'll always have a choice of whom to communicate with or not communicate with. And you certainly will never have to be bored alone.

Despite the fact that networking requires persistence and patience, its result is always new discoveries. Acquaintances with new wonderful people whom you otherwise would never have met. Discoveries of diverse exciting sides of life that you would never have explored if you hadn't made new friends. Finally, discoveries of opportunities that would be unavailable if you yourself hadn't taken that difficult first step.

Of course, networking isn't an end in itself but only a means of achieving a goal. This is a mechanism of continuous improvement of your life and self-improvement. As you surround yourself with an increasing number of people who in many respects are better, more literate, more experienced, more skillful, richer than you, you simultaneously get the opportunity to learn and enrich yourself in all senses of this word. The better and more perfect the people surrounding you, the better you yourself become and the better your life becomes. In conclusion, allow us to paraphrase the medieval Persian philosopher and poet Omar Khayyam and remind you that your life will be such as your environment will be.
