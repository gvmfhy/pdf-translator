*[Continued from Chunk 6]*

naturally deserves a comment or compliment, which, in turn, can dispose toward conversation. Any occasion is good for a compliment—from a stylish tie to a beautiful smile. Let's hope this won't be perceived by the stranger as excessive intrusiveness, especially when everyone these days fears accusations of "harassment."

Another set of options flows from the situation itself. If you're stuck in a cafe due to pouring rain outside or witnessed an accident, it's quite natural to express your opinion and respond to a comment. We still remember well one of the first exercises during our intelligence training. We were required to take a convenient position near one of the paintings in an art museum and try to strike up conversation with visitors by commenting on the painting. We counted how many such conversations lasting more than five minutes we could conduct within an hour. It was assumed that in five minutes of conversation, enough points of contact with a stranger could be found to ensure continuation of the relationship.

Now let's consider a couple of options you can create using yourself as a pretext. You can ask a stranger about something or ask them for help. Both options are quite trivial. However, your "target's" reaction depends on what and how exactly you ask. Here there's no limit to imagination. The same swindlers and pickpockets have developed a huge arsenal of tricks to attract attention and strike up conversation. You've surely had a case when a decently dressed man calls out to you and, pointing to a wallet on the sidewalk, asks if you dropped it? The performance such swindlers put on is so convincing that many of us ultimately spend several minutes in conversation with these types. We don't immediately understand that we're being scammed...

What if a person doesn't react to your question or simply smiles and passes by? This will happen if you unexpectedly jump up to a stranger in the middle of the street. In reality, the goal of a spy preparing to enter into contact with someone for the first time is to create a situation when your question or call for help cannot be ignored. As a professional networker, you must carefully select questions that will help you start a conversation. The harder it is for a person to ignore your questions, the better.

The same is true for maintaining dialogue and holding your contact's attention. When you listen to "small talk" at a party, you understand that all conversations revolve around a couple of hot news items and several standard topics representing general interest. If you constantly follow sports, cultural, and political news and are aware of the most discussed topics, this should suffice to support conversation with a new contact and direct it in the direction you need. We'd recommend having in your head a "list" of in-demand topics to which you can always redirect conversation.

## How to Ensure the Next Stage of the Relationship

After you've managed to successfully "support" conversation with a promising contact, your main goal is to ensure the next meeting with this person. We hope you'll use all your active listener skills to interest the person in conversation with you. We also count on you focusing on your contact in conversation, not on yourself. We assume that for the first conversation you've prepared some topics and questions that might arouse your interlocutor's interest. For example, if it suddenly turns out in the course that the person is a fan of a sports team, try to get them to somehow comment on its performance (at least if the team demonstrates success). We advise accumulating enough topics and questions in advance for maintaining interesting conversation. Your task, before conversation ends, is to understand what proposal regarding continuation of the relationship you can make so the person won't refuse it. One way to build a "bridge" to the next meeting is to ask your interlocutor for friendly advice or offer them something they need. However, this "something," at least for the first meeting, shouldn't imply obligations that would require much time and resources from your new friend. Professionals call this "something" a "hook" that gives you reason to address the person again. Based on your interests and capabilities, you should have a collection of such "hooks."

One of the notorious tricks used by special services and criminals around the world is the so-called "dented bumper." Its essence is that someone's car literally collides with yours. The "culprit" will offer sincere apologies and express readiness not only to cover all damages but will also invite you to dinner and give you a gift to erase unpleasant memories in your head. Obviously, the goal of all this is to create some reasonable pretext to spend as much time with you as possible for establishing relationships!

We, of course, don't suggest damaging others' cars for establishing relationships, but you should have several strategies in reserve. Depending on who your "target" is, this could be an offer to meet an interesting person you know or to share some information on a topic important to your contact. Even if you don't possess such information now, you'll certainly find something worthwhile if you search well on the internet or among friends. People rarely say "no" to such non-binding proposals. For them, this may mean a gesture of politeness, but for you it's a valid reason to continue dialogue.

## Consolidate or Lose!

When conversation is finished, your main task is to ensure the next step. We strongly recommend returning to your newly acquired contact within the first 24 or at least first 48 hours after the meeting. We followed a simple rule: whatever happened, we sent reminders the morning after meeting. You need to remind your new interlocutor about yourself before memories of conversation with you fade in their head, especially if they had other meetings that day. In your call or message, definitely mention what aroused the contact's interest and what makes your next interaction logical and justified. For example, your promise to help with something.

As a professional networker, you must create a database of your contacts. And this isn't just a contact list in your phone with names, workplaces, and birth dates. You must be able to record details of your conversations and note progress achieved in relationships, as well as enter data about the past, interests, and peculiarities of your contacts. Subsequently, such things will help you analyze relationships and find the sources of problems if such suddenly arise. At the end of the book, we'll offer a template you can use to create this type of notes. For an operative, such a database is priceless. By the way, we suggest you save contact information on a USB drive rather than on a computer, or even print and store in a safe place. You never know what can happen with phones or computers these days and who will get these priceless notes in case of account hacking!

Corporations have long used specialized Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software of varying complexity. If you like technology and gadgets, you can rent some of these software products as a service for managing your personal network of connections for a relatively small fee.

Oh, and one more thing! Since memories quickly fade—such are the peculiarities of human memory!—there's a probability that in just a few hours many details of conversation will simply be forgotten. Therefore, please get into the habit of making notes while the trail is hot, preferably the same day. Moreover, you need to force yourself to do this even if you're very tired. When you get used to it, such routine won't be a burden; it will become your second nature.

If it seems to you that we're demanding too much from you, compare this with the system created by one of the world's greatest networkers, considered one of the leaders of the "secret world government"—David Rockefeller, who died at age 101. As Joan Lublin writes in the Wall Street Journal, "Mr. Rockefeller recorded contact information and details of each of his meetings with more than 100,000 people from around the world on 3-by-5-inch index cards. In total, he accumulated approximately 200,000 such cards, which were inserted into a Rolodex machine specially built for him. For more than half a century, this 5-foot-tall electronic machine stood in his personal office at Rockefeller Center in New York."

As head of Chase Manhattan Bank and prominent philanthropist, Rockefeller "tracked an endless number of connections with the wealthy and famous, stretching across borders, disciplines, and interests—from fellow business titan Bill Gates to the Shah of Iran, President John Kennedy, Pope John Paul II, and Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on the Moon." "Thanks to this unusual recording system, he could continue conversation with a person he hadn't seen for many years as if their last meeting was last week." "During lunch at his estate in 2015, Mr. Rockefeller gave Mr. Kissinger copies of his 35 Rolodex cards. They contained notes about hundreds of their conversations that had taken place since their first meeting in distant 1955," writes Joan Lublin.

"Mr. Rockefeller understood the importance of contacts during his service in army intelligence abroad during World War II," Lublin continues in her article. "My effectiveness depended entirely on my ability to create a network of people with reliable information. I can quickly figure out the essence of my past relationships with anyone before meeting them again," Mr. Rockefeller wrote in his memoirs in 2002.

What else can be added to this to convince you finally? Fortunately, today there's no point inventing special Rolodexes for such databases. Open a page and dictate—the computer will do the rest. But David Rockefeller's incredible experience once again emphasizes the main idea of our book: if you work on your "ecosystem of connections" purposefully and systematically, networking will become a powerful tool capable of changing your life.

# Chapter 4. Developing Relationships

## Becoming a "Gardener" of Human Relationships

So, the first meeting was successful. Now you're acquainted with each other. But building meaningful relationships is a long path, and here many "minefields" lie in wait for you. As in the desert, you observe mirages from time to time. It seems the new stage in the relationship has almost arrived, but soon you understand that the relationship is still far from its final stage—mutual trust.

In movies, spies use sex, violence, and blackmail to achieve their goals. In real life, a spy's most powerful weapon is closeness and trust. On screen, spies crack safes to obtain certain secrets. In reality, everything is different. Others do this for them—those with whom they've become friends, whom they sympathize with and emotionally empathize with. Those who consider being a friend and helping much more important than guarding someone's secrets. Even people who trade secrets for money or transmit confidential information for some other reason count on trust and emotional support from the spy as a person on whom their well-being and possibly even life depends at the given moment. They must be confident that the person who knows more about them than anyone else will protect their secrets, respect them, and care for them. At the foundation of major successes of all intelligence services, whether we're talking about the famous aristocrats of the "Cambridge Five" who worked for the Soviet Union during World War II or about the chief of the London station of the KGB's First Chief Directorate Oleg Gordievsky, who spied for MI-6, lay relationships of sympathy, empathy, support, and friendship that developed between agents and their handlers. A spy's art lies in building relationships of trust, confidence, and dependence.

Of course, in relationship levels there exists a whole spectrum of gradations and shades from casual acquaintances to close friends. Discussing what happens in the Productivity Circle, we noted that for relationships to lead to important results for you, they don't necessarily have to be very close. Mutual trust is a delicate thing, and it's difficult to achieve with all contacts. However, for relationships to be considered stable and productive, they need to be brought to a certain level. In such a situation, a spy, businessman, or any other networker becomes a kind of "gardener" who "grows" relationships, protecting them from "winds" and "weeds" in hope that someday they'll bear desired fruits.

## Two Stages in Relationships

The process of building relationships consists of two stages. The first stage lasts from first contact until the moment relationships acquire stability. This means there exists an understandable reason for continuing personal communication between people that isn't tied to a specific event or deal. However, by standards of emotional involvement of participants, such relationships aren't necessarily close. At this stage, you can't expect a person to do for you something that would require great effort and especially risk on their part.

The second stage consists of deepening relationships. Now people truly open up to each other and become "accomplices." Accomplices in the sense that they trust each other sufficiently to share personal secrets and take business or personal risks together. Obviously, many relationships won't see the second stage, but the closer they approach the point of mutual trust, the more opportunities they open.

It seems some people are simply created to be together, created to be friends. However, in most friendly relationships, as in marriage, success depends on the parties' efforts as well as their talent. The problem is that the talent for building relationships, like any other talent, is rarely distributed evenly. Even among spies. Some manage to "skim the cream" from a large number of contacts, sacrificing depth, while others know how to "squeeze" maximum depth and result from fewer connections. There are many cases when one officer establishes contact with a potential recruitment candidate and then passes them to a colleague for study and development. Just like hunters and gardeners—each has their own methods and path to success.

Do you have acquaintances who seemingly know everyone and everything but seem incapable of building deep relationships or talking with anyone "heart to heart"? Or maybe you have only a few close friends, but you've known them since childhood and they'll be with you your whole life? You probably already feel which part of the relationship-building process comes easier to you and which skills need work.

Don't equate sophisticated "socialites" with those who know how to effectively develop useful connections. For example, at the beginning of our operative career, we envied people succeeding in "small talk" at parties. We considered this a skill that definitely needed to be mastered to build proper relationships. The ability to support conversations "about nothing" is useful in itself, but as our subsequent experience showed, its importance shouldn't be overestimated. Champions of "small talk" aren't necessarily effective in terms of influencing others. If you want to hold an interlocutor's attention, it's much more useful to learn to ask good questions—people are more likely to express their own opinion than listen to yours. Not being the "most talkative" person at a party is no obstacle at all.

The process of deepening relationships has its own dynamics. You can observe sharp growth in interaction intensity—with daily numerous calls and meetings—but there are also lulls when nothing happens. Problems and misunderstandings may arise whose causes no one can explain. There are good meetings and not so good ones. Being in a relationship is like floating down a river. You'll see the next turn only when you approach it. Holistic analysis of relationship dynamics is more useful than reflections on the success or failure of some individual conversation. Each meeting has its own context, purpose, and mood. In some cases, your partner may falsify their behavior and, misleading you, produce the desired impression. But falsifying the relationship as a whole, of course, won't work.

## Three "Legs" of Relationships

Relationships between people are like a chair—for reliable support they need at least three "legs." The more "legs" your relationships have, the better, but three is that minimum ensuring their survival. The three "legs" are Common Interests, Emotional Empathy, and Common Social Circle. Of course, there are relationships that rest on only two or even one of these three "legs," but they're subject to much greater risk of breaking. How many stories can you recall about happy coexistence of two different worlds in the spirit of "Beauty and the Beast" involving your friends? Most likely, very few. How much time do you spend with people with whom you have not the slightest common business, interests, and compelling reasons for meetings? It can be pleasant to chat with them—but what then?

Common interest in relationships implies the possibility of mutually beneficial exchange, whether material benefits, business ventures, friendly communication, emotional support, or something else. If common interest is unclear, the other two "legs" in relationships are often insufficient to maintain relationships for a long time. People meet less and less often, and the connection between them gradually blurs.

Emotional empathy is mutual affection that promotes "synchronization" of personalities. We're talking about temperament compatibility, similarity of views and experiences. However, such similarity doesn't mean being alike—for those striving for intellectual or interpersonal stimulation, opposites can indeed attract and enrich each other.

Common social circle can be defined in narrow or broad sense. In both variants, they relate to inclusion in a common environment, both professional and purely social. In the narrow sense, it includes your active personal contacts within the Productivity Circle with whom you do business or spend leisure time. In the broader sense, Common Social Circle represents a group of people with the same position in society—by income level, education, or social status. Practical experience shows that people from groups that are socially dissimilar and distanced from each other maintain stable long-term relationships only within some very specific events or projects, say, hunting trips or visits to the bathhouse. As the old saying goes: "Birds of a feather flock together."

## Stabilization and Consolidation of Relationships

Your goal at the very beginning, when establishing relationships, is to introduce a person into your Productivity Circle, strengthen connections so they don't break at the first obstacle. Here the key word is "stability." Usually at the very beginning, the context of relationships is quite specific. Imagine a person agreed to meet you a second time because you promised to introduce them to a venture investor. In this case, your contact sees in you only a path to achieving their specific goal. And even if their startup gets funding, you'll simply be a participant in their relationship with investors. And if they suddenly don't get money, then in their eyes you'll remain "the person with whom they wasted time." That's why your goal is to move this budding relationship from the specific context of investment opportunities to a so-called "neutral" state—a situation when the relationship is no longer tied to a specific deal, event, or promise. What now unites you depends only on what you both like or what you're both doing.

In this sense, the story of Soviet spy Richard Sorge, whom English writer Tom Clancy called "the best spy of all time," deserves attention. Sorge's incredibly friendly manner, charisma, and talent in establishing connections helped him find common language with the most vigilant and difficult people. In 1933, after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Sorge went to Japan under the "legend" of a German journalist who allegedly sympathizes with the Nazi regime. There he met military attaché of the German embassy Eugen Ott, who subsequently became Nazi Germany's ambassador to Imperial Japan. Over time, Sorge managed to transform these initially purely professional contacts between an ambitious official and an interested and obliging reporter into deep personal connections covering all aspects of life, including even a romance with Ott's wife! Ultimately, Ott developed boundless trust in Sorge, becoming for him the main source of critically important information about Japan and Germany's strategy and military plans. The results achieved by Sorge allowed him to occupy a special place in the ranks of great spies.

## "Exchange Currencies" of Relationships

Now it's time to deal with another networking myth. This is the myth of "true friendship." We've heard the opinion that relationships formed with a specific goal, whether business advancement or satisfying one's own ego, are somehow flawed. It's believed that there are either "real" relationships or those in which one party somehow manipulates the other. The idea is that relationships that aren't completely altruistic are actually "fake" and therefore in some sense vicious.

Let's debunk this myth. Practically all connections you have in your Support Circle are devoid of material interest, unless we're talking about some family business. This is natural. However, if you look carefully at your relationships in the Productivity Circle—from very close friends to new acquaintances—you'll understand that, regardless of relationship depth, both you and your vis-à-vis still have a certain reason for communicating with each other, and this reason is connected with some expected benefit. Perhaps this isn't the only, and maybe not even the main reason for maintaining your relationship, but it's present one way or another. When this reason doesn't exist...
