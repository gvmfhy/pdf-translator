# Preface. Intelligence Is Networking

## Why We Wrote This Book

Networking is the building of a social network, the use of connections to achieve success in life and career.

A spy is a professional networker. Finding new contacts and developing relationships is their primary job. This occupies most of a spy's time on a daily basis. Which means they must do this work correctly. And think strategically, planning every step. In such important and responsible work, it's impermissible to waste time and make mistakes.

In fact, networking is practically the only activity of spies—aside from, of course, cracking safes between sips of vodka martinis, if you believe the popular "movie versions" of their craft. First, spies constantly search for "sources"—that is, people. Second, they build relationships with people who represent interest to them. Preferably close relationships. So close that people are willing to share their most intimate secrets. At the same time, professional spies constantly work on their own development and advancement in society to enter circles where decisions are made. In this process, they develop extensive networks of contacts.

Spies are specially trained to study people. Over time, gaining experience, operative workers become magnificent practical psychologists. They can literally see right through people, and the ability to develop relationships becomes the most important of the skills they possess. They are likeable, friendly, convincing. As professional recruiters should be.

Unfortunately, even spies don't receive special training in strategic networking. Such a discipline still doesn't exist. Gradually, as a result of years of trial and error, each operative worker develops their own networking practice. Moreover, many don't even realize they have a strategy. Most don't think about networking in such categories.

We spent nearly a quarter century in service as illegal intelligence officers under deep cover, successfully working with people of many nationalities and carriers of different cultures. Behind us are many victories, but we didn't avoid mistakes either. Illegal work, during which we had to pass ourselves off as citizens of other countries, became invaluable experience for us. We built our networks of contacts from scratch: in four different countries, in three different languages. We had to create a fourth in our homeland, Russia, where we returned after a twenty-five-year absence. We came back to a country that had changed beyond recognition over a quarter century. Here we found ourselves without friends, "our own among strangers," speaking our native language with an accent.

This book is an attempt to share our networking experience. Although there are many books devoted to this topic, and some of them are really good, all these books can be divided into two groups. The first presents advice and recommendations that will help you gather contacts more quickly at various events and develop communication skills. Such skills are undoubtedly useful, but just as a general commanding an army doesn't necessarily need to be the best marksman, these skills alone won't necessarily help you build long-term, productive relationships with people, let alone teach you to strategically manage your network of contacts.

The second group of networking books consists of collections of various stories from the lives of people who've built successful careers as company executives or motivational speakers. Stories about how outstanding networkers achieved success are indeed motivating, but they're not very useful for people without off-the-charts egos who aren't spoiled by huge offices with crowds of subordinates. Moreover, most of the business realities and communication traditions that the authors of such books describe are unlikely to exist anywhere else besides the United States of America.

In our book, we wanted to look at networking through the eyes of intelligence professionals. We tried to make the book as close in spirit to a training manual as possible. We were guided by the desire to make our experience useful to the widest possible circle of readers.

A true professional in any craft is distinguished by having a system. Such a system goes beyond a set of best practices and life hacks. It has its own philosophy and includes a set of rules that make acquired experience reproducible. For example, if you study many books written by different writers, you'll discover certain rules of plot construction and character development that make novels successful.

Such networking rules, applied systematically and thoughtfully, even with fairly average execution, will enable any person to build a quite solid network of contacts, which, in turn, will help them achieve their set goals in life and business. True talent in networking can be multiplied by the systematic process that talented people often lack—just as an uncut diamond acquires value when a true master takes on its faceting.

At any mention of strategy, a natural question about the goal immediately arises. Admittedly, a spy doesn't engage in networking for fun. They face a whole series of operational tasks. For example, building trusting relationships with a specific person, which will require many intermediate steps. Or perhaps influencing some government organization. In any case, careful goal-setting plays a key role in any important matter. Without setting tasks, progress in networking cannot be measured and evaluated—that is, you'll never understand whether you've achieved excellence in this field or, as they say, contented yourself with easy prey.

The idea of writing a book and sharing our experience in networking as intelligence officers under deep cover is dictated by our desire to help readers use their personal connections to achieve important life goals. We sincerely hope that afterward, you too, in turn, will share your experience and successes with others...

## What We Will Tell You About

We'll begin with defining strategic networking as purposeful, professionally conceived social interaction of a person with their environment. In doing so, we'll consider networking as structured, systematic activity. Behind every system and strategy there's always a theory. To become more effective, people must understand why they do what they do. "There's nothing more practical than a good theory," as the famous psychologist Kurt Lewin said. That's precisely why we'll start our book with a brief overview of some aspects of the theory of personal social connections that we'll need later.

We'll explain what personal social networks are and how they function. This will give you the opportunity to map your own personal network and conduct a deep analysis of it. Once your network of contacts is schematically transferred to paper, you'll be able to clearly see your true place among the people around you, understand the strengths and weaknesses of your relationships. Then you'll be able to plan the steps necessary to expand your network, make it more productive, and raise your status in society.

Next, we'll proceed to setting networking tasks and discussing the subtleties of building relationships with people. We'll examine this process from the very beginning—from evaluating the person you'd like to meet and first contact with them, to building relationships and developing mutual understanding, trust, and friendship.

The book's content is designed to lead you from understanding the basic principles of networking to practical methods, and then to a strategy for developing relationships with your environment. We strived to present the planning process in networking as clearly as possible. This should help you thoughtfully set tasks and see progress in your daily work. The book also includes a series of step-by-step recommendations and templates that will help you hone your networking skills.

Then we'll rise to the next level of networking. If developing relationships with one person is essentially micro-networking, then interaction with a group of people or an entire organization can be called macro-networking. At this level, there are specific rules, workarounds, pitfalls, and best practices.

The results of your networking inevitably depend on your social status: the higher you are in the social hierarchy, the easier it is to attract people to you, the greater the "reach" of your network, the more opportunities you have. Ideally, you surely want interesting people to come to you themselves, rather than you chasing after them! To achieve this, you need to become an important, noticeable, in-demand person. In short, become a star!

We'll discuss how you can raise your social status, advance in organizations, become noticeable in society, and effectively interact in the social environment in which you find yourself. Since more and more communication is now moving into the virtual world, we'll also pay attention to your virtual connections and virtual status.

Your success in networking will most likely not come immediately. Practice will require effort—sometimes quite significant. But these twenty-five years of illegal work weren't easy for us either! At least you won't have to worry that your persistent, purposeful, and successful networking efforts will attract counterintelligence attention!

# Introduction. Networking from a Spy's Perspective

We humans are social creatures and constantly interact with other people. Moreover, most of the time we don't even pay attention to how and why we do this. Visiting relatives, meeting with friends, or chatting with a couple at the neighboring table in a cafe—this is all networking, an integral part of our life. You could say that as long as we live, we do nothing but constantly establish contacts.

But for some, networking is a source of income, the basis of existence. More precisely, their life and well-being depend on how well they can establish necessary contacts. Spies, politicians, diplomats, journalists, salespeople, and all those whose earnings and careers directly depend on communicating with other people will agree that networking requires a thoughtful, active approach. We'd like to focus on networking as a professional activity and strategic way of managing interpersonal interaction. This requires a special, systematic approach to your social activity.

Remember one saying? "He who doesn't plan his victory plans someone else's." Intelligence operatives are obsessed strategists. Work constantly forces them to think ahead. Would you really go to a dead drop with compromising microfilm or to a meeting with a valuable agent if you haven't mentally rehearsed all scenarios of possible developments beforehand? Conduct an important operation without thorough preparation?! Well, good luck to you! A spy uses a similar approach almost automatically when creating their network of contacts.

Let's start by debunking one common myth: strategic networking, contrary to popular opinion, is aimed not at all at acquiring a circle of friends. We're talking about developing a purposeful approach to relationships with those around you, about achieving life goals through creating and managing such relationships. Networking and friendship are certainly related things, but still different. And to be honest, close and reliable friends are merely a by-product that may arise as a result of networking.

Or may not arise. For example, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, four-time president of the United States and perhaps the chief "architect" of the world we live in after World War II, never had close friends in his entire life. He was known as a person who easily struck up relationships and just as easily exited them. Generally, he was calculating and vindictive. Which, however, didn't prevent him from perfectly mastering the art of managing people around him and influencing them. His entire history of ascending to the pinnacle of power was connected with strategic networking.

At the foundation of strategic networking lies a view of your place among others, so to speak, using a "bird's eye view." This allows you to consider your relationships with people, as well as all relationships around you, as a dynamic "ecosystem." Once you have a map of this ecosystem, you'll be able to consciously navigate it and manage its development, using your time and resources more meaningfully and effectively.

A clear example of the value of such a "view from above" is your daily commute from home to work and back. There are several ways to get from point A to point B. You can not overthink it and go the traditional route—that is, sit stuck in traffic on the main street, losing tons of time and nerves in the process. It's the same in networking: you can spend weeks unsuccessfully trying to get through to the secretary of a very important person whom you desperately need right now...

needed to solve some business problem.

Or, if you look at city traffic from above—say, from a drone camera—you can easily find detour routes along less congested streets and get home or to work much faster. Seeing which streets are empty is impossible without having the overall picture before your eyes. In exactly the same way, the ability to simultaneously see all existing connections around you will help you understand that the important person you're so eager to reach happens to have a close friend who attended the same school as your spouse. Thus, to chart the best path to a specific person, you need a MAP of all your contacts.

However, before you can devise the best way to bypass "traffic jams," you still need to determine your direction. Before discussing HOW to make networking more effective, we must clearly understand WHY we need it. For instance, Franklin D. Roosevelt dreamed from childhood of becoming President of the United States, and throughout his entire life, all his efforts to create a network of necessary connections were focused precisely on this goal. You too need to decide what goals you want to achieve and who the people are who can help you with this. Your first step is to clearly define your "goals."

As young Soviet intelligence officers who had just begun work in a new country, we, of course, knew WHY we needed a network of personal connections. But where to start? We were overwhelmed by the enormity of the task. Yes, we made many acquaintances, these new contacts required more and more of our time, attention, and care, but they didn't bring us any closer to anything interesting. Remember the famous fable "The Swan, the Pike, and the Crayfish"? We felt that our relationships were pulling us in completely different directions. It was frustrating. We had created a set of relationships, but could this be called an effective network that served our purpose? Only with great stretch...

What we really lacked was strategy. Strategy, by definition, is a path to a goal, a certain trajectory. As soon as you think about a trajectory, many other questions arise. If you want to move from point A to point B, where exactly is point A? Why do you want to reach point B? Are there alternative routes? Which one is better? And by what criteria?

So, to think strategically, you need a method. It provides clarity and directs your efforts. We knew how to find people and develop relationships, but we didn't think about how to assemble them into a network that would work for us and on our behalf. At the beginning of our journey, we were tacticians, not strategists.

Strategic networking is not simply building relationships with a specific person. It's achieving your life and career goals with the help of all the people who surround you. In a properly built network, each connection strengthens other connections. Together, they reinforce your position in society as a whole.

Looking back, we understand that our career as intelligence officers under deep cover represents an amazing experiment in networking. As young operatives, we started our networking from scratch. We arrived in the country of our first assignment with only one suitcase. We repeated such insertion from scratch three times in three countries. And then, after the notorious spy scandal in the United States and the exchange in 2010, a fourth time—already in Russia. Because at home, in our homeland, by that time we knew practically no one except our parents and a few more employees at the headquarters of Russian foreign intelligence with whom we worked. Since we left to work abroad, 25 years had passed. Even school and university friends wouldn't recognize us now.

Understanding how strategic networking works came with our own many years of trial and error. Four university degrees and thousands of the most diverse contacts behind us gave us the opportunity to look at our rich practice as if from the outside. Years of intense work helped us develop a conceptual approach to strategic networking. Remembering our first years in intelligence, we can say with confidence that, armed with the right strategy, we could have achieved in a year or two what we then spent a full five years on. We would like to share this power of strategic networking with you.

Before moving forward, let's answer some questions that people have asked us when we shared our networking experience. Not surprisingly, most questions concerned motivation and psychological barriers that hold people back from implementing specific plans.

The most common problem cited is the time expenditure necessary to create an effective network of contacts. With our eternal busyness and deficit of attention, which even our loved ones receive from us only in the interval between work and household chores, where can we find time for full-fledged networking?

Let's be clear: networking really does take a lot of time. Building connections can sometimes be very emotionally draining. But as soon as you decide that your future depends on the people around you and that having a good, well-oiled network of contacts is important, and you build it correctly, build it strategically, you'll save a massive amount of time and effort.

As soon as you decide to embark on the long journey to a more significant position in society, know this: the further you advance, the easier and more enjoyable the movement forward itself will become. As in any sport, whether running, chess, tennis, or golf—the first steps are never easy and pleasant, but then, with known persistence, you'll definitely catch your second wind.

Another excuse is reference to "lack of talent" for communicating with people. It's unpleasant to watch how your female friend, who chatters non-stop, effortlessly acquires heaps of admirers and sponsors for her business. "Something's wrong with me," immediately flashes through your head. But you're wrong. Believe me, there will always be those around who are smarter, more beautiful, more elegantly dressed, richer, or simply luckier than us. But in reality, such people are quite rare. Most people around are the same as everyone else, including you and me.

When it comes to networking, we create ourselves. One of our first mentors during intelligence training said that "you can't teach someone to be a spy—you can only learn it yourself." It's the same in networking: you acquire experience and skills only in the process. There's no other way.

Frankly speaking, even after many years of operative work, we admit that we're far from the most gifted in creating interpersonal connections. But with acquired experience, we know how to maximize the opportunities given to us by nature, how to listen to those around us to catch what's most important, how to minimize mistakes, and how to motivate ourselves to move forward despite rejections and failures. So you too can learn this.

Is strategic networking ethical? Don't all these strategies introduce something unnatural into human relationships? Doesn't it seem to you that we're manipulating people? If you build relationships with people according to your "secret" plan, don't such relationships become "fake"?

Such an important question cannot be left without attention, so there's no point in postponing it. In any relationship, there are two sides. It's easier to start with yourself. When you really need someone, for example for your business, or if you simply fall in love with someone, your attempt to attract such a person by all reasonable and honest means is not just entirely justified, it's quite natural.

Romeo's nightly serenades under Juliet's window would probably be perceived by our contemporaries as excessively extravagant, but hardly anyone would condemn his romantic impulse. Literature, art, and life itself around us abound with examples of attempts to seduce or win someone over. In the overwhelming number of cases, we have no doubt about their sincerity. Moreover, in movie and book heroes, we admire precisely the persistence with which they seek someone's favor.

And then everything depends on whether this person accepts or rejects you. Regardless of how your acquaintance goes, he or she can always say "no." Perhaps you'll manage somehow to "impose yourself" at the first meeting, but you won't be able to forcibly invade someone else's life. Moreover, the more you insist, the stronger the rejection will be.

Now let's look at networking from the perspective of the object of your interest. When you buy a lottery ticket, you can't be sure that you'll necessarily win. Rather the opposite: you're quite skeptical about winning. However, you would never refuse the prize if you suddenly hit the jackpot. Meeting people is also a kind of lottery. There are people whom you dream of including among your friends, but you don't know how to achieve this. At the same time, you're surrounded by certain individuals whom you don't want to see at all. Attitude toward people depends on what value they represent to you—emotional, aesthetic, material. Perhaps among your friends you'll find several with whom you became acquainted completely by chance. And, thanking fate for such a chance, you don't care too much about how this chance appeared.

Therefore, what matters is not how you establish or develop relationships, but what you bring to these relationships and how you treat the person who's important to you. Networking as a discipline gives you skills for meeting people and developing relationships, but you yourself determine how and why you use these connections in your life.

But what networking definitely does is force you to constantly learn from others. Moreover, within the framework of your strategy, you'll purposefully seek people who know more than you, who are better than you. Thanks to networking, you'll become richer in many senses. Your professional value will grow faster. You'll achieve better mutual understanding with loved ones, with colleagues, and with management. Having become accustomed to thinking strategically, you'll notice problems earlier, avoiding painful conflicts and loss of friends. And we guarantee—you'll become wiser.

# Chapter 1. Networking Tools

As illegal intelligence officers, we performed three tasks simultaneously. Our main task, as should be expected, was gathering intelligence. The second was "work under cover"—well, that is, our "everyday" activity that allowed us to explain our income and interests. The third task consisted of creating a network of contacts and strengthening social status—constant, often exhausting, ascent from the bottom of society to its peaks. In fact, all our visible free time—walks, holidays, sports activities—had to somehow fit into this third task. Such work never stopped and required enormous effort and time, but without it we would have been useless as spies.

Every profession has its own toolkit. Whether you're repairing household plumbing, designing collectible clothing, or teaching economics at a university, you rely on specific knowledge, skills, and equipment without which desired results cannot be achieved. Mastering such skills and bringing them to perfection usually requires years. Certain professions require special abilities from a person, such as musical ear or abstract thinking. It's important to note that each profession forms a certain way of thinking and method that's just as inseparable from the profession as its working tools.

Spies, who hone their operative art over a long time, develop a special memory for people and relationships. Just as an artist can reproduce in detail a previously seen landscape, and a pianist can play several symphonies without looking at the notes, an experienced professional operative is capable of storing in memory the details of many people's stories and the particulars of conversations with them over several years.

A spy's main weapon is their connections. And their main quality is the ability to deal with many situations and people, to learn, adapt, predict, endure, change, and achieve their goals. In short, to understand and organize things and people around themselves. Without initiative and an internal sense of direction, a spy would immediately find themselves in an uncontrollable whirlpool of complications and dangers. The mentality of an operative officer, as an organizer and planner of their environment, defines their strategic approach to networking. To practice this strategic approach, see mistakes, and think systemically, we need to understand what networks of contacts are and how they function.

## "There's Nothing More Practical Than a Good Theory..."

When we create a network of people we need around us, we're essentially weaving a social fabric that connects us with the rest of the world. Constant social interactions allow us to protect ourselves, earn money, produce offspring, and advance solutions that affect our society. The connections we create depend on who we are, what we like, what work we do, and with whom we live. We have enemies and friends, bosses and subordinates. Such interactions aren't random. They truly describe and define our life. The bonds that connect us are regulated by laws and customs and are emotionally charged. They're built into the context of our surrounding environment.

We are social beings who survived, developed, and prospered because we learned to work together despite personal differences and preferences. To survive, we accepted rules and hierarchy, accepted the necessity of interdependence that makes us a family, a platoon, a corporation, a country, humanity. Our desires, beliefs, and occupations unite us into various groups—from startups and football teams to Masonic lodges. We cannot live without relying on mutual material and emotional support. Such sets of stable relationships around us are called networks.

Relationships between people can vary greatly in duration, strength, and intensity. They can be short-term or lifelong. They rely on different motivations—from the opportunity to quickly earn money to unshakeable devotion. Many chose terrible death instead of abandoning their friends, or gave everything they had to other people. Our thinking and characters are formed by those we know. And in some cases—for example, for businesspeople or spies—our value consists of those we know. For such people, social, interpersonal connections constitute their working capital—in the most direct sense of the word.

## Types of Personal Networks

Let's start with describing what personal networks are. Several types can be distinguished. They can be formal, such as those defined by various laws and rules or fixed by organizational structure, as, for example, in a military unit. They can be informal—just recall a Friday evening party when you gather with friends somewhere in a cafe to drink and relax awaiting the approaching weekend. In the latter case, there's no subordination, no hierarchy, no rules at all.

Social networks can be not only local or global but also real or virtual. Now, when there's Facebook, VKontakte, LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, various forums and other similar tools, most of us sometimes have even more virtual friends than those we've ever met in person.

Networks can differ in their purpose—for example, work or leisure. A network or part of your network may belong exclusively to you personally or to you as a member of a group—for example, your contacts in a client company managed by your team.

And finally, networks can be active or "dormant." Imagine people with whom you graduated from school many years ago and whom you meet at best once every ten years on the anniversary of your graduation, or your childhood friends in your hometown, to which you visit from time to time...

## Your Network as Your "Reflection"

Your network will in many ways reflect your individuality. It will depend on whether you're a man or a woman. Your network will change with age. For example, ten-year-old girls have more girl acquaintances in their networks than boys, but at 16 everything may turn out to be exactly the opposite.

Developing relationships, we naturally gravitate toward people of one level of prosperity and social position. This is also true regarding age groups, races, and ethnicity. In the intelligence world, it's widely known that the success of Israeli and Chinese special services largely depends on their use of cohesive ethnic communities around the world.

Just a few decades ago, when the world wasn't so interconnected and globalized, the fact of being born in one region and especially in one locality played a large role in strengthening social ties. Now, however, meeting a fellow countryman has no special significance for most people. Much more often we define ourselves by what school or university we attended.

As a rule, the more diverse someone's network of connections from the point of view of types, social position, and nationality of the people you know, the greater value it can potentially bring and the more opportunities it can offer. A diverse network significantly increases your social and career mobility and creates a bank of useful life experience.

Some factors defining the formation of our networks can be considered a given. One of them, for example, is our family background, which, at least up to a certain age, plays a dominant role in our interactions. Another factor is our genes, which control our networking as if from behind the scenes. As in romantic relationships, they determine our preferences without our knowledge. They lead us to people with whom we can become close, although their characters and views may sometimes seem absolute opposites of ours.

However, as our long intelligence career has shown, a much larger number of determining factors of the network is entirely in our power and under our control. They depend on how we see ourselves, what our life goals are, where and what we study, how we earn a living. They depend on our conscious decisions, religious practices, hobbies, interests, and places we choose to live. By managing these factors under our control, we can build new connections and purposefully develop our personal social networks.

## Connection Map

If we want to develop networks, we first need to understand what they are and what they look like. Otherwise, we won't be able to understand what's happening with them and how to fix emerging problems. There are different ways to draw a social network, so we need to agree on some rules. Since each of us has our own imagination, we can draw pictures of the same social network in different ways. When we first tried to depict our networks during our mission, doing so turned out to be difficult. We made several attempts to place all our contacts on a sheet of white paper, but at first everything looked wrong. The realities of our relationships didn't fit into the framework of the scheme we had in mind. Try now to take a sheet of paper and draw a map of your relationships. See for yourself how difficult and unpleasant this will be. For us, the scheme began to acquire some meaning only after the fourth or fifth attempt. That's precisely why we'll offer some recommendations for optimizing and simplifying the process of building a picture of your network.

Let's mentally plunge into the era of Great Geographical Discoveries, into the times of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama. What made those grandiose journeys possible? Somewhere at the end of the 15th century, cartographers invented a coordinate system with which each point on Earth could be precisely plotted on a map. Various maps had been used since ancient times, but they showed only land contours. Maps using a coordinate system accelerated a revolution in navigation. They gave travelers the opportunity to set out for distant, unexplored places without the risk of losing their way. The main thing was that they could see the sun or stars and had with them a few simple navigation instruments and a clock. Similarly, a map of your network will help you not get lost and feel confident in your relationships. This will make your network much more productive.

As an example, let's draw a map of a simple network. Imagine a student from Thailand living in the United States of America who, to somehow supplement her budget, also works somewhere part-time. If we place our student as a point in the center of the map, we should have two sectors on the map representing the country where she currently lives—the United States—and her homeland—Thailand. We can divide these country sectors into work, home, and other corresponding areas. Then we plotted her fellow students and teachers at the university, roommates, work colleagues, and her relatives on the map. In the USA, we'll have only her university, work, and neighbor connections, but no family members. Friends, however, will be in both countries. Step by step, we can make this picture more detailed, more complex. I think you got the idea... The ability to map your environment will help understand some important concepts related to network development.

## Network Density and Its Significance

One important concept is personal network density. It's calculated by dividing the total number of existing connections between people in the network by the number of all potential connections, and varies from 0 to 1. Simply put, if your network density equals "0," this means all your contacts are separated from each other and not connected to each other at all. Sales specialists, as a rule, have low-density networks because they have separate relationships with unconnected clients. If your network density equals "1," then everyone in it knows everyone else. This is quite typical for a study group or a team in a production workshop.

What can density tell us about a given person's network of contacts? Good or bad network density, as such, doesn't exist. Spies are forced to keep the density of their networks at a fairly low level to keep their information sources as far apart from each other as possible and thereby reduce risks of leaks and exposure. A low-density network is also ideal for sales specialists. However, for a department manager in a department store, such a network would already look questionable. In the latter case, it means that teamwork in the store is absent and the manager may not be aware of what's really happening in their department.

From a management perspective, network density is a very important concept. If a manager's network density is very high, this means they don't have many connections outside their organization. In other words, they're simply stewing in their own juice. Such a person should probably start asking themselves whether such a situation is favorable for their career growth. However, from a management perspective, very low density is also not the best option. If you don't have enough connections in your own organization, perhaps something is escaping you.

In a stable group, when people live and work together for long periods of time, the density of their network increases. Relationships in the group become closer, warmer. The level of emotional support and mutual commitment grows.

Having familiarized yourself with the concept of network density, we can now better understand the significance of the connections we see on the network map of our Thai student. Individual parts of her network in Thailand have greater density than others. The connections on the map show that at the university and at work, she's not a member of any particular group. Perhaps she'll be very lonely and uncomfortable in the United States. When a person is accepted as a full member of a community or group, the feeling that they're superfluous here, alien, gradually disappears.

---

## Three Levels of Relationships

The next concept concerns the distance and purpose of relationships between you and people in your network.

Place yourself mentally in the center of your network and imagine three concentric circles. We call them Functional Circles. The first, inner circle usually consists of closest friends and members of your family. These are the people you trust most. You can, as they say, pour your heart out to them when the occasion arises. You can turn to them in both joy and sorrow. They form your Support Circle. Unfortunately, when it comes to everyday concerns, to your work and career problems, people from the Support Circle can hardly help you. And all because you've already taken advantage of what they can offer you. All you can do with your Support Circle is maintain existing relationships so that at the right moment you can turn to these people again.

The next circle is usually more densely "populated." It contains the overwhelming majority of people with whom you deal in one way or another. We call it the Productivity Circle, because almost all your useful interactions, all work and social activity happen precisely there. The Productivity Circle helps you achieve results. You know everyone in the Productivity Circle fairly well, you've already formed stable connections with them, but this doesn't mean all these people are so close to you.

The positive point is as follows: to be useful to each other, people don't at all need to become close friends. You can't, and shouldn't, be on friendly terms with everyone. As the example of the same Franklin D. Roosevelt shows, this doesn't prevent a person from achieving even the most ambitious goals. And President Roosevelt isn't the only outstanding networker who didn't make close friends. Another prominent example is former U.S. President Barack Obama.

You'll be surprised how many wonderful things people you barely know can do for you. Especially if they see mutual interest in such communication and if you ask them correctly. Your goal for members of the Productivity Circle is to identify the most important relationships and make them strong and productive, bringing the corresponding people closer to yourself. For spies, the most intense work on "establishing" relationships happens precisely in this circle.

Beyond the outer boundaries of your Productivity Circle lies another area, the so-called Development Circle. Essentially, this is the "horizon" of your network, where new contacts appear. This area plays the role of a kind of bridge between your network of contacts and the rest of the world. New people can enter the Development Circle but then disappear if relationships don't become stable and purposeful. They can return there again if you make some efforts or if external circumstances change. A dual strategy applies to the Development Circle. On one hand, you need to fill it with new people, creating a continuous flow of additional contacts into your network. On the other hand, you must study new people who appear on the horizon of your network and move those who represent interest into the Productivity Circle.

## Three Main Rules of Networking

Let's move to the basic principles of networking. They're surprisingly simple. In fact, they can be reduced to three simple rules. Let's imagine that communication between people is a flow of electrical signals. You can view your network as a set of light bulbs connected to each other. Such connections form nodes. Some nodes can be small, connecting only a few bulbs. But some turn out huge—with hundreds, if not thousands, of connections. The same thing happens with human connections. Some of us easily establish many connections. You surely remember that among the people around you—at school or at work—extremely sociable people constantly appeared who always had an extensive circle of friends and who were always in the center of attention. Let's call them "connectors." Every such person's birthday was always packed. By their nature, such people always attract attention; others are drawn to them.

**The first rule of networking:** discern, seek out "connectors" around you and build close connections with them. By getting close to them, you gain access to parts of their own networks, including those people you wouldn't have had the slightest chance to meet personally.

What are relationships? Essentially, an exchange process. This can be an exchange of goods, emotions, or information. In fact, every conversation is also an exchange, at least an exchange of attention to each other. When people offer you something, they expect something in return.

To offer someone something, no matter what exactly, you must have it—for example, money, information, or something else. Where to get this "something" for exchange with others? Most often—from those members of your network who have access to it, whether professional knowledge of stock markets or tickets to the Bolshoi Theater. It turns out that in this scheme, you're like a broker who produces nothing themselves but still contributes by facilitating the process of concluding a profitable deal.

In your network—if we again use the analogy with an electrical circuit—there are people who accumulate within themselves a lot of "something useful" that flows around. Let's call them "capacitors." Usually these are quite respected people. Others constantly turn to them for advice. In organizations, they possess institutional memory. If you find such "capacitors" and competently build relationships with them, they'll be able sooner or later to share their "accumulations" with you. As soon as you get something to share, you'll have the opportunity to exchange with people in your network. Using what you've acquired as a kind of currency, you'll be able to raise your status or exchange it for what you need. For a spy, the search for such "capacitors" who could become information sources constitutes the most important part of the work.

From the above follows **the second rule of networking:** identify "capacitors" around you and establish close connections with them.

In our imaginary electrical circuit, there are some elements that can disrupt or amplify energy transmission—"breakers" and "conductors." In social networks, these are "gatekeepers" (doorkeepers) or, conversely, "bridges"—that is, people who can put obstacles in your path or, conversely, open new doors. For example, your boss's secretary, depending on the quality of your relationship with her, can play the role of either "gatekeeper" or "bridge." If your relationship isn't great, her likely answer to your request for a meeting will sound like this: "You know, he's so busy right now. Maybe next week..." And, conversely, if you have a good relationship and you urgently need to see the boss, she'll answer: "Okay, I'll call back now."

People who give you access to other networks, organizations, or countries can also act as "bridges." Do you have, for example, friends from Brazil? If not and you suddenly need to fly there, you'll most likely find yourself alone in a country that may initially make you feel insecure. However, if you have a friend from Brazil—essentially your "bridge"—then she or he with the help of a couple of emails or phone calls can easily mobilize their local connections. And then you'll get the most pleasant and unforgettable impressions from your trip!

All this leads us to **the third rule of networking:** identify people who will perform the role of "gatekeepers" and "bridges," establish relationships with them so that they work for you, not against you.

Let's summarize. Very briefly, for networking it's important to acquire "connectors" and "capacitors," as well as establish relationships with "gatekeepers" and "bridges."

## How to Draw a Map of Your Network

Now, armed with theory, it's time to get to action and draw a map of your network. American writer Mark Twain once said: "The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one." The first steps in creating a map of your network will be the most difficult. That's why we want to explain them as simply and clearly as possible. Remember: strategic networking begins with strategy, and your strategy begins with building a map of your current network. Let's do everything in stages, step by step.

**Stage 1**
Take a large sheet of white paper and place a dot in the center. This dot is you. Then draw two circles around the dot. The first small, and the second larger, so that between the circumference and the edges of the sheet there's about ten centimeters. These are your Functional Circles. The first, as you remember, is the Support Circle—your relatives and closest friends. The second is the Productivity Circle, in which the majority of your stable connections will end up. The area beyond this circle will be your Development Circle—the horizon of your network, where new contacts appear. Draw radii from the center to the edges of the sheet. These lines form sectors—some larger, some smaller—that represent areas of your life, such as the office, your clients, educational institution, or leisure activity—those areas that correspond to your relationships.

**Stage 2**
Let's start placing our connections on the map: one person—one dot. If a person is important to you, make the dot bigger, fatter. You can use your smartphone contact list as a database. Decide for yourself how many people you want to place on the map. Stick to a reasonable approach: hundreds of people's phone numbers are usually recorded in a smartphone, but you don't need those you barely know and in whom you don't feel particular interest. Try to mark each dot with names or initials.

**Stage 3**
Then you can draw lines between you and other people that will reflect the nature of your relationships. To make the picture legible, mark only important contacts. If these are very intense relationships, choose a thick line. For sporadic relationships, use a dotted line. You can draw arrows on the lines to indicate who usually takes initiative. If initiative is mutual, arrows can be multidirectional. In exactly the same way—with lines and arrows—you can connect people in the network who know each other.

As soon as all connections are plotted on the map, think about how to indicate their quality. Pluses can represent positive, dynamic relationships, minuses—relationships with which you're experiencing some problems. And finally, highlight groups in your network that are connected by a particular interest with color. And voilà! You're almost done!

Although no! Not quite yet... In the end, it may turn out that some sectors or rings are too small to accommodate all the people you'd like to "stuff" in there, and some are almost empty. Although the basic principles of building a network are simple and intuitive, you may need several attempts and a bunch of wasted paper before you finally arrive at a more or less satisfactory variant that correctly reflects reality.

Don't worry, we warned you: it will take several attempts! Our suggestion to draw a network with circles, lines, and dots is just a recommendation. Don't rush and try to draw a clear and comprehensible map. If it works out—great! If not—don't despair and find another way for yourself. And remember—your network will change and the contact map will need to be corrected from time to time.

# Chapter 2. Networking Strategy

We hope you now understand how social networks function. It's time to delve deeper into the topic to reveal important ideas and introduce you to the most optimal methods. Developing a network of contacts is what we—consciously or unconsciously—do every day. Although how we do this depends on our personal qualities and lifestyle, there are still some "standard" skills that need to be improved in order to generally comprehend the networking process.

It may seem that the fairly specific networking methods we used as spies working under deep cover are inapplicable, for example, in the career of a beginning actor or financial analyst. In reality, universal networking mechanisms can be adopted by any person, regardless of age, profession, or nationality. It's just that spies tend to act somewhat more decisively and with greater emphasis on specific operative results.

As soon as you apply the "bird's eye view" described earlier to your contacts, you'll almost immediately discover problems and shortcomings of your personal network, such as low speed of acquiring new contacts, marking time in developing relationships with some people, or insufficient coverage. Considering various problems we encountered from time to time during our work as operative workers, we came to the conclusion that most of them are common to all and require fairly standard actions. If you learn to recognize them, you'll eliminate the overwhelming majority of obstacles in relationships, which will significantly improve your personal and professional life.

Based on our experience, typical difficulties are as follows:
• Setting adequate networking goals
• Building a networking strategy
• Acquiring new contacts
• Developing productive relationships
• Fixing problems in relationships
• Strengthening influence in groups and organizations
• Raising social status among those around you

In subsequent chapters, we'll describe how to overcome all these difficulties.

## From Life Goals to Networking Priorities

Many years ago, we, beginning spies, arrived in the country of our first foreign assignment. However much we wanted to gather useful information and quickly achieve results, we felt an acute need for emotional support. Around us there were no relatives or friends. Worse still, we had no social status that would support our self-esteem and make us significant partners for others. Our low, practically zero, social status didn't allow us to actively establish connections with interesting people, so necessary for intelligence work. In addition, it was necessary to build relationships with our immediate environment to try on and adopt local behavioral norms and customs. In other words, we needed a Support Circle. Over time, we established connections with neighbors, doctors, librarians, store and restaurant owners, local parishioners and clergy. After several sessions with a chiropractor—by the way, our peer—we struck up a friendly relationship with him. It lasted several years—until we had to move to another city. Interest in singing and music led one of us to a church choir.

---

*[End of Chunk 3 - Pages 41-60]*


*[Continued from Chunk 3]*

As a result, we gained not only the opportunity to spend time with pleasant people but also to establish important contacts with the local priest.

As we gained experience and confidence, our networking priorities shifted toward developing effective "cover" and acquiring higher social status. And then, when several years later our two sons were born, we discovered a completely new chapter in networking—the amazing world of parent relationships—on playgrounds and at school. In the following ten years, a completely different life opened up for us, a different network of contacts, different priorities. We established connections with many people in many countries, shared common interests, and interacted with representatives of different strata. Behind us were important professional achievements that gave us confidence to move forward, to break through to the higher echelons of society.

Finally, when at the end of a career in intelligence stretched over more than twenty years, we faced unexpected betrayal and arrest, our networking goals shifted to new priorities—recreating a circle of connections in Russia, where we returned with the whole family. Our path shows that every person has to rebuild their network of contacts and surround themselves with new people every time they themselves change and the circumstances of their life change.

Whatever the current needs in networking, they're determined by life goals as well as immediate priorities. It's impossible to overestimate how important correct goal-setting is for success. Without clear priorities, your interactions will inevitably turn into unpleasant, direction-less, aimless bustle that takes time and drains you emotionally—with extremely low returns. However, as soon as goals are set, your networking strategy immediately acquires meaning.

---

## Circle of Goals

A more complex method of goal-setting requires revising your long-term life plans. To successfully transform your goals into strategy, you need to answer the question of what specific steps will help lead you to achieving your goal. Whatever ideas and desires you possess, making them concrete enough to guide your networking is a quite serious task. To facilitate this task, we developed a simple scheme. And we used it every time we felt we needed to pause and reconsider our priorities.

On a sheet of paper, draw three concentric circles in the center. From center to edge, call them "What," "Who/Where," and "How." We recommend dividing the circles with radial lines into four sectors. The sectors will help you focus on various aspects of life and career—for example, Finances, Health, Family Life, Interests, or Personal Growth.

In each thematic sector of the central circle, write down one to three main goals you've set for yourself—for example, "have more friends," "earn more," "become a more interesting person," or "improve relationship with daughter."

Remember those who can provide help in achieving each of your goals or on whom their achievement may depend. In the next circle, opposite the goal "earn more," write in the names of people who can potentially help with this. Similarly, opposite the goal "become a more interesting person," write in the names of people you know or would like to know and who can participate in your personal and professional growth. If you can't immediately remember the names of the right people, write down where such people can be found—for example, in some professional association.

In the outer circle, opposite the name or place, write a short answer to the question of how you intend to build relationships with the right people and who can connect you with them.

Writing down problems and setting short-term and long-term goals helps systematize your thoughts. Regardless of how accurate or detailed the initial answers may turn out to be, every time you return to the circle and try to answer the questions, you improve your ability to achieve set goals.

---

## Assess Your Resources

As soon as you've determined your goals, proceed to analyzing the people you know. Copy your phone contact list and distribute people into groups such as family and family friends, former classmates, work colleagues, as well as people you meet at sports facilities or during other events.

Using knowledge of networking theory, find those who can act as "connectors" and "capacitors" in your network of contacts. Identify "gatekeepers" and those who will become a "bridge" for you, paving the way to other people or organizations. This will help distribute contacts by priority and usefulness for further development, as well as highlight those who are potentially capable of connecting you with other needed people.

If you feel that your main problem in networking is creating new contacts, give priority attention to building relationships with "connectors." Along with some of their contacts, you'll acquire new opportunities as well. Besides people who act as "connectors" due to some personal qualities, there are also those who are such by virtue of professional activity. Take a closer look at journalists, politicians, public relations specialists, bloggers, lawyers, lobbyists, charity fundraisers, recruiters, and HR managers you encounter from time to time—all these people must definitely enter your priority contact list!

"Capacitors," in addition to providing some valuable advice, are also capable of connecting you with many useful people. University professors, bankers, museum curators, art gallery owners, writers, and artists usually always attract interesting people who are already part of certain power structures or strive to be as close to them as possible.

If it's still difficult for you to approach certain organizations, remember the "bridges" you need to build there. As soon as you establish a reliable connection with a representative of a particular professional group—say, with some doctor—expanding contacts within this group will be much easier, and you'll be directed from one person to another.

In the process of building a network of contacts, you'll meet people with whom you'll definitely want to become friends, regardless of what roles they might play—simply because you like them.

And finally, don't forget about your "frozen" contacts—friends with whom you haven't communicated for some time. Usually these are people with whom you went to school together or worked. But these can also be people from other time periods of your life. Resume communication, ask them about work, about what has changed in their lives, and then regularly remind them of yourself. Become a member of alumni associations of schools where you studied, show activity. For example, for one of us, diplomas from several authoritative universities in different countries, including Harvard University in the USA, opened many "doors" around the world and gave significant impetus in forming a circle of friends.

## Pipeline of Contact Opportunities

For a spy, establishing contacts is daily, in a way even "routine" work. Their Development Circle must be constantly filled. To become a true networking professional, you must view all interactions as a pipeline of opportunities for developing new relationships.

Expanding your network of contacts, you'll inevitably be obliged to exit your comfort zone. In intelligence, inability to work outside your comfort zone means professional unsuitability. A spy must find common language with any person. Like many other skills, the ability to work effectively beyond your usual communication environment is acquired and perfected through practice.

When it comes to expanding contact opportunities beyond your usual environment, you'll face two main challenges. The first is connected with the growing isolation of our everyday relationships within comfortable groups, despite the giant opportunities provided by communication means. Incidentally, virtual social network platforms have exacerbated this problem. They've facilitated building enclaves in internet space for social and professional groups that enclose a person in a shell of established contacts with people who hold similar views and life positions. Anyone who doesn't share the group's dominant opinion quickly becomes an outsider who has no place among "our own," "correct" people.

If you want to expand your network of contacts beyond its current limits, be prepared to discover new places and social circles for yourself, break through the barriers of professional groups. You'll have to accept that overcoming such barriers can be painful, and gaining recognition in circles unfamiliar to you may require considerable time.

The other challenge is connected with the necessity of establishing relationships with people located higher than you on the social ladder. High social status usually comes with age. Each generation carries its own history, its own "code words," its own jokes and its own idols. To talk on equal terms with a person who is twenty or even more years older, and often much richer too, requires courage. To interest such a person in yourself requires certain talent. And for you to occupy a permanent place as a friend in such a person's life, you'll have to find such common interests for which age and social position don't matter. The constant search for this "common ground" that reduces social distance is the essence of "networking upward."

There's a category of people for whom it's easier than for others to build relationships with high-status people—these are journalists and people of the arts. Their professions provide opportunities for direct access to celebrities. Some even become their partners or lovers. It's worth recalling Camille Claudel, the student and then lover of the great French sculptor Auguste Rodin, or Paula Broadwell, who wrote a biography of American General David Petraeus. The technique of "networking upward" is based on the fact that with age and status, people prefer to give rather than receive. Sincere interest in their experience can help you find approaches even to persons who seem unattainable. Such networking requires creativity and courage, but it also develops creativity and courage. Therefore, don't be afraid to try—even failure will enrich you with priceless experience.

Your strategy for building a pipeline of contact opportunities should be twofold. First, ask your friends to introduce you to their acquaintances. Now you understand why you need the "connectors" we talked about earlier. And by the way, don't forget to thank them for their services!

Second, more often visit places where you can meet new people, participate more actively in various events, clubs, and online groups. Your constant occupation should be searching for places and events where you can meet interesting people. As a networker, you should compile and periodically update a list of such places. Keep statistics of your contacts to understand which of the places and events you visit give the best opportunities for meeting people.

## Those Terrible 30%

At first glance, it seems simple enough. But not everything is so good and smooth. We're talking about the so-called "30% rule." It turns out that if you don't make additional efforts, you'll most likely lose up to 30% of people in your network of contacts annually. Some of your acquaintances will leave the city, get married, or simply forget about you; others will break off relationships for some other reasons. And so on. Such a proportion of losses is fair not only for ordinary people but also for spies, who, considering the large influx in their networks, often refuse many opportunities that don't seem particularly promising. The "30% rule" means that to simply maintain the existing number of connections, you need to develop up to 30% of the total number of contacts annually. Frankly speaking, this is no easy task!

---

## "Wholesale" Networking

To compensate for the inevitable loss of the mentioned 30%, you need to find a way to quickly acquire many good contacts. For example, the position of head of an interesting project is an excellent opportunity to legally and purposefully build connections with a large number of new people in a short period of time. We call this "wholesale" networking. Participate in as many projects or events as possible that unite large groups of people.

Don't see such opportunities or projects around you yet? Try applying a creative approach: come up with something yourself! By the word "project" we mean any idea that makes people unite—from political discussion groups to running enthusiast clubs. Any such project will contribute not only to developing your network but also to your own professional and personal growth!

Such undertakings usually carry a pleasant bonus—meeting interesting and important people. Here, by the way, is an example from our own experience: the desire to expand the network to the highest decision-making circles led us to open a software development company in the USA. We later continued this activity in Russia as well.

---

## From Quantity to Quality

Don't get the impression that the main thing in networking is increasing the number of contacts. At some point, your network will reach such a size that adding more and more new people will simply become meaningless. You won't have time to properly manage relationships with all your numerous contacts. You'll need to focus primarily on improving the quality of your network. For a spy, network quality is more important than its quantity. The "Pareto Principle" applies to intelligence too: 80% of intelligence work results will be obtained from less than 20% of available contacts—the most valuable sources. The quality question will return you to the fundamental problem—distributing contacts by priority. You need to decide which of them you need most and why. This will also force you to filter contacts and remove from the network those that don't "work." Actually, this is exactly what, for example, sales managers do.

The same can be said about the quality of your relationships. At the very beginning of life together, when you and your partner are adapting to each other, you may encounter some tension in the relationship. Approximately the same "adjustment" happens with people entering your network of acquaintances. Aimless connections leaving ambiguity and misunderstanding will drain your energy and ultimately let you down at the most necessary moment when you're counting on them. Regular analysis and cleansing of your relationships, weeding out non-working connections will save you from many problems and unnecessary headaches.

If you want to become a successful networker, you need to think strategically, become purposeful and effective. You need to understand which relationships bring you closer to life and business goals, and invest in their development first. To improve the quality of your network, you must clearly imagine the underpinnings of relationships with each contact. "Rejecting" useless or unhealthy relationships may seem cynical, but in reality we do this constantly, consciously or unconsciously. By letting go of relationships that don't work, you avoid potential disappointments and open opportunities for new, more useful and promising contacts.

---

## Creating "Dossiers" on Your "Development Targets"

To ensure networking success, you must learn as much as possible about your contacts: about their lifestyle, characters, and motivations. In the professional jargon we used, there was such a word—"objektívka." It implies a brief report about a particular person. This can be anyone—from a foreign state minister arriving to discuss an important treaty to a subject under police surveillance. Usually, when our minister is going to negotiate with his colleague, intelligence provides him with two documents—one describing the supposed negotiating position of his counterparty, and another—with information about the opponent's personal character, his strengths and weaknesses—from testimony of diplomats who negotiated with him before, to what coffee he prefers, how many children and pets he has, and what he calls his mistress. Not surprisingly, the second document is often much more curious and in demand than the first.

The same need to understand who is before you applies to any of your potential contacts. You can't truly develop a relationship if you're not interested in what kind of person this is and what their needs are. Sincere curiosity, the desire to understand your acquaintance's way of thinking, their actions—all this remains the most reliable guarantee of developing a relationship with them. Such genuine interest on your part will be automatically read by the person's emotional sensors, ensuring agreement and reciprocity. The more facts about a person you learn, the better you'll understand their character, needs, and motives. That's precisely why, especially in the early stages of relationships, it's necessary to collect a "skeleton of facts" about your "target." Without such a "skeleton" of facts, it's often difficult to correctly interpret someone's behavior. Imagine that at a party you organized, a new contact pays too much attention to the fair sex. You'll form quite polarized opinions about the person, depending on information about whether they're married or not.

Collecting information about your contacts should become a constant routine. Try to build a mental "model" of the person and understand what drives them in life, what makes them happy or angry, whom they love and whom they can't stand, what's happening at their work, and much more of what determines their actions. An invitation to visit, visiting your interlocutor's home, or meeting their family will be especially productive from the point of view of collecting priceless facts that will help you understand them better.

## Your Information Sources

In our time, there are masses of ways to collect information about practically any person. Most of us leave a solid information trail consisting of posts on virtual social networks and presence in numerous public databases. To start, simply google. If you found some basic information—about what the person does, where they work and live—google these organizations, look at maps of the area where they're located. Information will help you imagine what surrounds the person every day, what they have to deal with, what they might feel. Simply put yourself in their place...

However, as always, the best and most current information still comes from people, and the closer they are to the target of your interest, the better. The simplest and surest way to understand a person is to ask those who know them. There's nothing wrong with you asking such questions—if you can explain why you need this information. If you want to meet with a person, then there's your reason. Just go and do it! As spies, we had to exercise special caution not to arouse suspicions, but for everyone else it's much simpler. On the contrary, it might even awaken curiosity in the person you're questioning.

When police or special services require more information about a suspect but need to do it secretly, without publicity, they develop quite convoluted ways to talk with their colleagues and neighbors, pretending to be couriers, sociologists, former girlfriends, and so on. You'd be surprised to learn how much information a person living next door can tell a stranger about you, provided the stranger knows how to ask about it correctly. During training in intelligence preparation, we conducted dozens of such "neighbor interviews," each of which required comprehensive role-play development to properly prepare reactions to all possible answers.

In many cases, the meeting place itself provides some basic information that helps in establishing contact. Conferences and other thematic events are actually designed to give people the opportunity to meet each other. In addition to coffee breaks, stands with contact information, and specially designated meeting places, such events provide detailed information about speakers and participants, giving everyone the opportunity to visit the corresponding website before a personal meeting and get a preliminary idea. It makes sense to run through the participant list and mark potentially interesting people for yourself in advance, as well as read about speakers. All this will make your contacts more purposeful and first conversations more fruitful. By becoming a speaker at an event, you'll thereby further increase your chances of becoming noticeable and acquiring new acquaintances.

# Chapter 3. First Contact

Any relationship between people begins with first contact—whether at a personal meeting or in virtual space. Not for nothing do they say: "you never get a second chance to make a first impression." First contact is even more important for a spy: inability to make the right first impression not only prevents entering someone's trust or, say, earning more: often it puts an end to a carefully planned operation and nullifies the efforts of many people.

Thanks largely to Hollywood, most people imagine spies as cold, calculating, even excessively closed and cautious. Recall Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow in the popular franchise from Marvel Comics. Although, to tell the truth, the opposite is actually true! The most successful spies are, as a rule, pleasant, friendly, and extremely open people.

Perhaps this is that rare case when James Bond in his image isn't so far from the truth. His charm and seduction skills are far more effective than any of Q's clever gadgets he hides on himself. Interestingly, neighbors of exposed spies whose names subsequently became public knowledge overwhelmingly considered them among the very best people they'd ever met... And that's how it should be! To become a good spy—or a good networker—it's very important to be able to make a positive impression. Rufina Pukhova-Philby, Russian wife of the famous Englishman Kim Philby, who collaborated with Soviet intelligence for many years, recounted that her husband had such charm "that you wanted to tell him everything." In Moscow, he taught young spies this charm. He invented role-playing games. He himself played the role now of a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, now of a border officer.

That's why much in a spy's training is specially directed at maximum effectiveness in first contact. Our training usually included such exercises as establishing contact with a random person from whom specific information had to be "extracted."

For a spy, work on a "target contact" can begin long before personal acquaintance. That's precisely why we divide all initial contacts into two categories—prepared and spontaneous. They differ not only in the time you must spend forming an opinion about the person you're meeting, but also in risk, rather symbolic for ordinary people but very significant for an operative worker.

## First Meeting Scenarios

There are two possible scenarios for prepared initial contact. The first and best way to establish initial contact is, obviously, to be introduced by someone. Ideally, such an intermediary who introduces you to the right person should do so personally. Their presence is extremely necessary. Your friend vouches for you, immediately creating certain trust in the eyes of the person with whom you're becoming acquainted. If among your friends you can gather several such "connectors," this will ultimately give you a constant influx of new contacts in communication with whom "the ice," as they say, has already been broken. The interesting effect of "one of us" can be observed when you use some club or professional association as a platform for establishing contacts. As an insider—a member of the club or community—you enjoy this effect of camaraderie that helps you skip the very first stage of building relationships, when emotional interaction between people hasn't yet been established. For example, when someone brings a new person to our cigar club, by the end of the evening you can hear how new buddies are already fully discussing business plans or joint trips—thereby demonstrating a level of trust that in other circumstances would be simply unthinkable after a first meeting.

The second scenario is when after careful evaluation of a person, you use or create circumstances under which you and your "target" can enter into conversation. In both cases, it's most useful to study the person's character and sphere of interests as well as possible. This will allow you to prepare a number of topics for discussion representing interest to your contact, so that you can then maintain joint communication. Your questions need to give your interlocutor the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and status and feel that you value all this. In addition, such questions should serve as a pretext for subsequent contacts.

## How to Overcome Fear of Talking to a Stranger

However well you prepare, you're naturally haunted by the fear that your first contact will fall through. There's no point fighting these fears or trying to avoid them! Even after thousands of spontaneous contacts, we still worry before the next meeting. Although such fear can disorient and demotivate you, it can also make you focus better and ultimately achieve more. A healthy, normal attitude toward fear and stress can become a priceless asset in all spheres of life.

One of us once recalled their own fear before the first parachute jump. The ground was far, far below, and stepping into this emptiness seemed physically unnatural. Suddenly came the thought that almost everyone who made the same jump into the abyss ultimately landed safely—that is, in this game of chances, the numbers were firmly on the side of success. Yes, there are moments when you simply need to believe... At that moment, belief in success helped tame the fear, and it also allowed establishment of many "cold" contacts later.

Over time, you'll learn to manage your fear of communication. Spontaneous contacts are, in essence, the same lottery. Some attempts will surely turn out unsuccessful. Sometimes you'll receive categorical refusal that will unpleasantly hurt your ego. You'll be left with painful memories. But in the overwhelming majority of interactions, everything will work as it should. We guarantee it! So don't stop and make your jump!

## How to Prevent Rejection

During conversation, you'll have to balance between two opposite tasks—how to get the person interested in you, and how not to provoke rejection. No contact will work out if the object of your interest doesn't want to deal with you or, worse still, fears you. You must create appropriate conditions for involving the person in conversation.

Most advice you'll find in networking books comes down to establishing contacts during a coffee break at some conference or at a party when everyone is disposed to it. However, spies often have to work in an environment when acquaintance is difficult or unwelcome. Successfully involving people in conversation under such circumstances is already mastery of a completely different order.

The main thing stopping a person from full interaction with you is lack of clarity about who you are and what you want. Meeting you for the first time, people consciously or unconsciously assess risks and opportunities arising from acquaintance. What do you want from the new connection? What if you ask for something the person can't or won't give? Will their reputation deteriorate because of you? Are you a boring or interesting interlocutor? Can you provide useful connections? Therefore, a professional spy specially prepares to dispel the concerns of the person they're meeting as quickly as possible. The key question to which an operative worker must give a convincing answer sounds like "Why are you approaching me?" And until you offer your interlocutor an understandable reason for your interest, the person will be uncomfortable with you. The art of a professional lies in finding or inventing such a reason.

Quite recently I witnessed how you can ruin a seemingly completely guaranteed contact if you ignore the above-mentioned rule. One of my friends suggested I meet for three with an "interesting person"—the local head of one of the famous international clubs. Knowing my friend as an active "connector," I assumed that the conversation would be about involving me in the club's work. And then everything developed according to the most "disastrous" scenario. First, the "connector" himself didn't show up for the meeting, not even really trying to make excuses. Second, the "interesting person" himself was seriously late. Then he began talking about himself, about his projects and his hobbies. The club topic was raised in passing and only at my prompting. But most importantly, I never understood why he was meeting with me. During the entire conversation, my interlocutor never tried to find out what would interest me and offered nothing. The loneliness of my coffee cup on the table also didn't dispose toward a long conversation. We parted with complete understanding that there would be no continuation.

You'll also provoke rejection by showing too much initiative in cases when it's not welcome. A bit of personal experience. Many, many years ago, we as ambitious operatives often suffered from excessive ambitiousness. We wanted to achieve quick results, and this unambiguously manifested in our behavior. Now, recalling those first years from the height of acquired experience, it's even awkward to admit that we probably ruined quite a few good contacts then because we behaved too "pushily"!

Here's just one example from our many years of experience. Upon arriving in the United States, we became part of an exclusive community at one of America's leading universities. We received an incredible chance to gain masses of useful contacts. Many of our fellow students could potentially become important political figures, employees of government and military organizations, and even leaders of foreign countries. Truly a gold mine for a spy! Since the program lasted only one year, we felt we couldn't waste time. Having identified several "targets" for ourselves, we set about purposefully developing relationships with them. The very first contact—with a student with a military past—seemed especially promising. Encouraged by his first reaction, we used every opportunity to deepen the relationship: stayed to chat after classes, invited to lunch, met over coffee, visited local attractions together. Encouraged by seeming progress, we didn't take into account his need to communicate with other people too, especially at the beginning of studies when relationships between fellow students are just forming. In addition, as we subsequently learned, he had romantic designs on one of the students. In our desire to occupy the place of his "best friends," we didn't immediately guess that such persistence began to produce the opposite effect. Very soon the person simply began avoiding us. The relationship came to naught, and despite all our efforts, unfortunately, we couldn't restore it. The acquaintance distanced himself from us and preferred closer communication with other students. Fortunately, when in subsequent contacts we tried to build more balanced relationships with people, we achieved far greater success.

## "Behavioral Hygiene"

When you meet a person for the first time, it's necessary to give them enough time so they can get a better look at you, evaluate you, and get used to your presence. If you find yourself in the same room, try to spend some time in the field of vision of a potential contact so they can observe you. If you plan to speak, start with some predictable and positive topic. Not surprisingly, many conversations between strangers begin with banal remarks about the weather—it is what it is!

In addition to attempts to prevent fear connected with invading the personal space of the object of your interest during spontaneous contacts, you need to pay special attention to observing rules of so-called "behavioral hygiene." Your contact shouldn't feel any threat or concern. For example, showing up at an art gallery intoxicated and talking loudly, you'll create in your person a negative "attractor," becoming a "black sheep" in strangers' eyes and provoking their defensive reaction.

Take measures to eliminate all possible "impression killers": from bad breath and dirty fingernails to verbosity, excessively loud voice, or uncontrolled leg movements that people often make when nervous. And last but not least—without a smile and relaxed posture, you're unlikely to make a positive impression!

Perform a simple test: sit down for ten minutes somewhere in a shopping center or cafe and observe the people around. Some are sitting, some pass by. Divide them into two groups: those you'd like to meet, and those to whom you're absolutely not disposed. Agree: faces of the first category will look relaxed, confident, and smiling. That's exactly how you yourself should look if you want to attract someone.

People are most comfortable with those who resemble themselves, whom they understand. Ideally, you should dress and behave as a member of their social group, whether business or something else. If you manage to find out something about the person's occupation or interests before establishing contact with them, you can take a book related to their profession with you. This can also turn out to be a good aid in conversation.

If we'd written this book a generation ago, our standard recommendation would be to dress "well"—conservatively and even expensively, but now, when even billionaires wear nothing but T-shirts, former advice lacks particular meaning. Instead, we recommend you look "recognizable" so that your "target" can easily associate you with one of the respectable social types. For example, with a top laptop or tablet in hand, you'll easily pass for an IT professional. Many social classes and professions have their own unofficial uniform, whether venture investors in Patagonia vests, bankers in expensive dark blue pinstripe suits, or professors in tweed blazers with leather elbow patches. Let's hope that in any case you won't have a bloody knife or smoking gun in your hands, because otherwise your prospective contact will run away in fear...

If you can't look like a person from your contact's sphere of activity, try at least not to alert them with extravagances in clothing and things (unless you yourself are a movie star or some important person). If you want to strike up a conversation with a person in the neighboring seat on an airplane, wait until they get better settled, calm down, and begin to take interest in the surrounding environment. To play along a bit, try copying their pre-flight routine: take out several magazines, a pen or glasses; check messages on your phone screen. Or render your neighbor some small service without attracting special attention to your person: pass a bag or napkin. The moment when flight attendants serve drinks and food throughout the cabin is especially convenient for starting a conversation.

## The Art of Spontaneous Contacts

Sometimes you'll have no choice but to start a conversation without any information about the person standing before you. Such spontaneous contacts require special mastery. The main challenge facing you in spontaneous contact is ensuring continuation of interaction after the first meeting. You'll have to maintain conversation with a stranger while simultaneously trying to obtain enough information about the interlocutor's past, interests, or character to propose the next meeting.

Unfortunately, this isn't the only challenge for you. Despairing of interesting the person, many of us unconsciously begin to "advertise" ourselves. They tell how smart they are, how rich, how many important "bigwigs" they know. And they fail. As beginning spies, we repeatedly fell into such psychological traps. Yes, sometimes it's not bad to "sell" yourself a bit to somehow attract a person to you, but this is only a secondary task.

Instead, you should focus on making the person "buy you." The goal is that your contact should find it pleasant to deal with you. People are ruled by emotions. Creating pleasant sensations in your interlocutor during conversation means demonstrating your sympathy toward them. You need to set aside your ego and sincerely focus all attention on the person before you, showing your interest in them. Make an effort and try to almost love this person. All people, even very shy ones, love to talk about themselves. You've surely heard someone called the most pleasant person and best interlocutor merely because they didn't interrupt the speaker. Think about it! How, in your opinion, do psychotherapists create an environment in which a patient feels closeness and trust?

First contact requires you to completely focus on the reaction of the person of interest to you. The task is to develop and deepen this interaction and, God forbid, not push away a potential connection. You must be able to read the reaction to your words and gestures to clearly determine whether it allows continuing communication. The answer doesn't necessarily have to be verbal. Behind polite phrases may hide a demand to "back off," expressed through intonation or gestures. To assess the true reaction, focus your sensations on the emotional "temperature" of the interaction.

Awareness that our movements and subconscious actions constitute a significant part of interpersonal communication has become so widespread that the term "body language" has firmly entered modern lexicon. As spies, we practiced for many years the subtle art of demonstrating our own accessibility while simultaneously "reading" the interlocutor's subconscious signals.

Many books have been published with recommendations for reading signs of "body language." Some authors even reference their experience working in special services. However, as professionals with many years of operative work experience, we're honestly skeptical about their practical value for a beginning networker. First of all, the overwhelming majority of manifestations of people's physical reactions have not only strong cultural but also situational specificity. For example, almost universal gestures of goodwill and beginning conversation—such as a smile and direct eye contact—in some cultures can be considered excessively intrusive and even embarrassing. Reading other, even less obvious signs in people whose national origin and social behavior often have mixed character becomes increasingly difficult. In addition, we're raised from childhood to be polite and suppress true emotional reaction, especially with strangers.

Instead of trying to recognize any specific signs, a good networker must be able to catch and interpret the entire flow of behavioral signals coming from a person during interaction. Individual signals are less significant than the overall picture. If you carefully monitor the emotional state of those around you, you'll most likely catch signs of mood changes—irritation, boredom, hurry, or disapproval from a person of practically any culture and be able to react accordingly.

## Synchronization of Sensations

During interaction, your task is to synchronize your sensations with your interlocutor's feelings—to see yourself as they see you. This requires empathy. An example of such emotional synchronization is a situation when an interviewer, listening attentively, unconsciously imitates the interlocutor's posture and head tilt. To read a person's emotions, you need to mobilize your Emotional Intelligence abilities.

You've probably already heard about Emotional Intelligence (EI). Unlike "traditional" intelligence, which measures how "smart" a person is, EI focuses on a person's ability to be "wise" in dealing with their own emotions and others' emotions. There's a very good book on this topic by Daniel Goleman. He was one of the first to draw attention to the fact that a person's ability to understand others on an emotional level influences work success more than their professional skills.

Emotional Intelligence is our ability to understand our emotions, understand where they came from and what influences them. On one hand, awareness of one's emotional state allows controlling and managing one's own behavior. On the other hand, it provides the opportunity to correctly read others' emotions and behave in accordance with the current moment and social environment. You must have encountered speakers who continue boring presentations, absolutely not taking into account that half the listeners are already nodding off. This means the speakers don't know how to "read" the audience. They don't feel viewers on an emotional level, don't "empathize" with them in the current situation.

In networking, you need to keep your eyes and ears open to read another person's emotional state, detect changes in behavior, and correspondingly correct your action strategy. For a spy, constant observation of their own behavior and interlocutor's reactions becomes second nature. They live as if a GoPro video camera is mounted on each contact's head and they constantly receive audio and video stream with which they track their mistakes.

As practical advice for developing your own emotional intelligence, try spending a day with the "camera on," analyzing your sensations and feelings of people around you. You'll have something to think about!

By focusing all attention on your interlocutor, you simultaneously solve another problem people often complain about in first spontaneous contact—how not to forget the interlocutor's name. When you're told that someone couldn't remember the names of people they met at a party or meeting, this usually means it wasn't so important to them. We've never heard of anyone not remembering their new boss's name.

Honestly speaking, neither of us has special talent in remembering names. However, there's a three-step method that helps remember names. First, after you hear your interlocutor's name, try to use it as often as possible in the next several phrases of conversation. And if you still forget the name—ask again. If you've just met, there's nothing shameful in this. Second, try coming up with some nickname for your interlocutor based on how the person looks, what they do, or how you met—such associations stimulate memory well. And finally, write down the name you heard in a notebook or phone, and at the end of the conversation ask them to give you a business card. This will not only engage your visual memory but also warm your interlocutor's ego—they'll be convinced they made an impression on you.

## Initial Sorting – The "OIS" Method

In case of spontaneous contact, you can't allow yourself such a luxury as preliminary information about the person. It helps not only prepare good topics for conversation to interest the person but also make sure that communication with them won't create problems later. That's precisely why spontaneous contacts will require a spy to "analyze" and "sort" those they're meeting by the "OIS" method.

Meeting a person for the first time, a professional spy, regardless of how much time they have before handshake—months or seconds—must answer three critically important questions about the person: is they dangerous? interesting? difficult?

Such a scheme is very useful when you find yourself in the midst of a welcome party at a conference or, for example, at a distant relative's birthday. In both cases, you're surrounded by unfamiliar people.

Let's start with the "Dangerous" point. If a spy is somehow connected or even fleetingly noticed in the company of persons sought by police or participating in extremist organizations, this can mean surveillance or investigation, possibly with catastrophic results. The same applies to meetings with people from counterintelligence, criminal police, diplomats, or those who work in secret government laboratories. Accidental, unprepared contact with such people can easily lead to investigation and arrest.

For those far from the spy world, the list of dangerous contacts isn't so short either. Do you want to be associated with those who manifest hatred and threaten other people? Or with those who sell drugs? It's completely obvious that if you see or sense a potential problem—just leave. You'll be surprised how many emotionally unstable people are around. Their mood can change instantly, especially if you start arguing with them. And if you maintain conversation hoping it will somehow calm them, they'll "latch on" to you like ticks. And then getting rid of them will be almost impossible. If you think you're unlikely to meet such people in your environment—don't be so sure, think carefully!

When we were still undergoing training, one of our mentors who worked undercover in Asia for more than ten years told us a story. It once again emphasized the need to be extremely attentive in evaluating people with whom you enter into contact. In a hotel bar in one Southeast Asian capital, he met a person who in every way resembled a prosperous European businessman. After several shots, they found common interest: both were newcomers to the country and both planned to open their own business. The opportunity to invest in business with a "respectable gentleman" who, by his own words, already "had influential friends in the country," seemed too attractive to miss. However, from the first minute of meeting this person, our spy was alerted by something. By the end of the evening, he finally understood what it was: the gentleman had untidy fingernails with visible dirt under them. Later, after another check, it turned out this was a well-known local swindler. During the day he worked as a gardener to somehow make ends meet, and in the evening he switched to his "main business"...

For those who passed the "D-test" (Dangerous), there's a second evaluation stage—point "I" (Interesting). Not all contacts are created equal. Your time and resources are limited. You have to be pragmatic. If after some communication you don't see potential interest for yourself, slow down and think: either you'll "freeze" work with this contact for now, recording their details to make a decision later, or simply refuse them by skillfully ending the conversation.

By the way, beautifully ending a conversation is itself a mastery. If you do this incorrectly, your interlocutors will feel you treated them with disdain and will never forgive you for it. Exiting a conversation must be carefully prepared and correspond to the setting. We're sure you've been in situations when some people "stick" to you at the beginning of a party and don't let go for several hours, almost physically preventing you from communicating with others. Surely you, like us, can't stand such situations. In addition, such people prevented us from doing our work! Over time, we developed a whole set of excuse phrases from simple "Let me go to the restroom" to phone calls to each other that we presented as urgent requests from foreign business partners. We provoked such calls with secret signals known only to us two. We suggest you agree on something similar with a close friend or partner.

And finally, point "D" ("Difficult"). Unfortunately, sometimes even with quite interesting people it's very difficult to build relationships. This may be connected with significant differences in age or social position. But most often the reason is absence of favorable "chemistry." Having gained experience, sometimes already at the very early stage of interaction you'll begin to understand that no "chemistry" can be there. If you continue maintaining contact in the same spirit, such relationships will drag on without substantial progress in development and trust in each other. They'll turn out awkward, boring, formal, artificial, and difficult to maintain. Nothing useful will come of them. We're sure you have experience with such relationships. If there are no compelling reasons to preserve them, except the same family or financial obligations—let the situation go. You'll feel relief and, by the way, save yourself time. Here, again, if you doubt you can extract benefit from the relationship—just take the person's contact information and move on.

## How to Start a Conversation with Different Types of People

With spontaneous contacts, the question arises of how to start a conversation with different types of people. Describing basic character types and subtleties of communicating with them would require a separate book. Nevertheless, it's worth dwelling on how to act when meeting the most common types you'll be able to recognize even before entering into contact or in the first stages of conversation. Without delving into scientific terminology, let's take our personal operative experience as a basis.

It's easiest to start a conversation with "great communicators." These are people who are ready to talk to you even without your initiative to that end. Usually there's a smile on their face and in their eyes—restless interest in everything around them. They can't sit still without talking to someone anyway. You just need not to scare them away. One smile in their direction, a nod of the head, or a comment on any occasion will suffice to "turn them on." They'll gladly tell about themselves—you'll only have to manage the conversation by asking the right questions. The problem is how to "turn them off" afterward if you don't see interest in continuing contact. Unfortunately, for understandable reasons, among "great communicators" there aren't very many people vested with power and even fewer bearers of secrets.

Another type is represented by people who want to be the "center of attention." You'll recognize them by exclusive clothing, noticeable "artistry" in behavior, originality in choice of ties, gadgets, or jewelry. To confirm their self-worth, they need external attention and admiration. They do everything to be noticed, although this doesn't at all mean they want to strike up a conversation with someone. The key to starting conversation with such people is in a compliment that will let them understand that their efforts to be original and unique have been noticed and properly appreciated. In further conversation, they'll gladly talk about themselves. And if even before conversation starts they catch your interested and admiring glance—it will only be better!

If the first two types are by nature expressive and ready to support conversation themselves, the next two, as a rule, represent real difficulty for first contact. One of these difficult types is the "controller," who can be distinguished among others by a serious, focused gaze and position that allows them to better control everything happening around. Usually this is a perfectionist who respects life by the rules and often strives to impose their rules on others. In first contact with a "controller," your strategy consists of confirming that you too value order, understanding the rules this person follows, and perhaps even demonstrating your readiness to accept them. Therefore, in the first conversation it's worth focusing your questions on finding out how your interlocutor sees the world, what is "good" or "bad" in their coordinate system, while simultaneously giving them the opportunity to "impose" their vision on you. Beginning conversation with perfectionist controllers could quite well be a critical remark about some obvious problem, like flight delay...

And finally, the most difficult type for first contact—the "closed off." Such a person is usually in a position of "circular defense" in relation to the rest of the world. They trust no one and look for a catch everywhere. In public, such people are shy, silent, and focused on something of their own. Starting conversation with the "closed off" without an obvious, evident, important reason that would justify their risky exit from their "fortress" is unlikely to work. Even if you ask for help, there's no guarantee you'll receive it. Therefore, starting conversation with the "closed off" often resembles a psychotherapist's conversation with a patient. Your main task is to calm them. Moreover, due to high anxiety, the very physical approach to the "closed off" to a distance allowing starting conversation requires time and tact—the person must have enough time to adapt their world to your presence. One of us had a case when before speaking for the first time with one such "closed off" person, they had to spend almost a week at a neighboring table in the city library!

## How to Present Yourself Properly

It's quite predictable that in the head of the person you're meeting, it will first flash: "Who is he?" They'll immediately mentally begin a verification process similar to the "Dangerous-Interesting-Difficult" test we described earlier. Your task is to successfully pass such verification. The first impression of you will be visual, so we strongly recommend excluding all possible "red flags" in your appearance and, if possible, looking the same as your interlocutor.

As soon as you start conversation, you'll need to tell something about yourself, explaining what you're doing here and why you want to talk. You must give the person a good reason for conversation. In the operative language of intelligence, such an explanation is called "situational cover." We suggest you rehearse it in advance so it sounds smooth and answers the immediate questions arising in a person approached by a stranger.

A phrase like "...just finished a consulting project and would like to see the city center before flying to London tomorrow" might quite "work." After such words, the image forming in the person's head will consist of a number of positive points. You're a consultant. You probably have good education and decent income, so you're not going to ask for a loan. You give the impression of a person who travels a lot, so you might turn out to be quite an interesting interlocutor. You're inquisitive, and you have a bit of free time in reserve, which is why you started a conversation.

By the way, when you're preparing your "cover legend" to start a conversation with a stranger, we advise not lying about yourself. If you want to make a better impression and add facts to your story that don't correspond to reality, remember that sometimes strangers become close friends and may hear the whole truth about you from others later!

## How to Manage a Spontaneous Conversation

If you have enough information about the person you're meeting, pre-prepared topics for conversation and questions will give you the opportunity to manage the discussion. However, to start and maintain conversation with a person you don't know, you'll have to look for other approaches.

So far, no secret recipes have been created for starting and maintaining conversation with a person you don't know. All your ideas for how to do this you're forced to draw from three sources: the personality with whom you wanted to enter into contact, circumstances of the meeting, and finally, yourself. The art of conversation with a stranger lies in using your imagination and ability to squeeze maximum from such a rather limited set of options.

What ideas can come from the "target"? First, you can offer help if they have some problem. A person may drop something, stumble, or their phone battery may die. Perhaps it only seems to you that the person has problems, but this too will serve as a pretext. In both cases, you can introduce yourself and offer help. Second, a person may do something or look such that it naturally...

*[Continued from Chunk 6]*

naturally deserves a comment or compliment, which, in turn, can dispose toward conversation. Any occasion is good for a compliment—from a stylish tie to a beautiful smile. Let's hope this won't be perceived by the stranger as excessive intrusiveness, especially when everyone these days fears accusations of "harassment."

Another set of options flows from the situation itself. If you're stuck in a cafe due to pouring rain outside or witnessed an accident, it's quite natural to express your opinion and respond to a comment. We still remember well one of the first exercises during our intelligence training. We were required to take a convenient position near one of the paintings in an art museum and try to strike up conversation with visitors by commenting on the painting. We counted how many such conversations lasting more than five minutes we could conduct within an hour. It was assumed that in five minutes of conversation, enough points of contact with a stranger could be found to ensure continuation of the relationship.

Now let's consider a couple of options you can create using yourself as a pretext. You can ask a stranger about something or ask them for help. Both options are quite trivial. However, your "target's" reaction depends on what and how exactly you ask. Here there's no limit to imagination. The same swindlers and pickpockets have developed a huge arsenal of tricks to attract attention and strike up conversation. You've surely had a case when a decently dressed man calls out to you and, pointing to a wallet on the sidewalk, asks if you dropped it? The performance such swindlers put on is so convincing that many of us ultimately spend several minutes in conversation with these types. We don't immediately understand that we're being scammed...

What if a person doesn't react to your question or simply smiles and passes by? This will happen if you unexpectedly jump up to a stranger in the middle of the street. In reality, the goal of a spy preparing to enter into contact with someone for the first time is to create a situation when your question or call for help cannot be ignored. As a professional networker, you must carefully select questions that will help you start a conversation. The harder it is for a person to ignore your questions, the better.

The same is true for maintaining dialogue and holding your contact's attention. When you listen to "small talk" at a party, you understand that all conversations revolve around a couple of hot news items and several standard topics representing general interest. If you constantly follow sports, cultural, and political news and are aware of the most discussed topics, this should suffice to support conversation with a new contact and direct it in the direction you need. We'd recommend having in your head a "list" of in-demand topics to which you can always redirect conversation.

## How to Ensure the Next Stage of the Relationship

After you've managed to successfully "support" conversation with a promising contact, your main goal is to ensure the next meeting with this person. We hope you'll use all your active listener skills to interest the person in conversation with you. We also count on you focusing on your contact in conversation, not on yourself. We assume that for the first conversation you've prepared some topics and questions that might arouse your interlocutor's interest. For example, if it suddenly turns out in the course that the person is a fan of a sports team, try to get them to somehow comment on its performance (at least if the team demonstrates success). We advise accumulating enough topics and questions in advance for maintaining interesting conversation. Your task, before conversation ends, is to understand what proposal regarding continuation of the relationship you can make so the person won't refuse it. One way to build a "bridge" to the next meeting is to ask your interlocutor for friendly advice or offer them something they need. However, this "something," at least for the first meeting, shouldn't imply obligations that would require much time and resources from your new friend. Professionals call this "something" a "hook" that gives you reason to address the person again. Based on your interests and capabilities, you should have a collection of such "hooks."

One of the notorious tricks used by special services and criminals around the world is the so-called "dented bumper." Its essence is that someone's car literally collides with yours. The "culprit" will offer sincere apologies and express readiness not only to cover all damages but will also invite you to dinner and give you a gift to erase unpleasant memories in your head. Obviously, the goal of all this is to create some reasonable pretext to spend as much time with you as possible for establishing relationships!

We, of course, don't suggest damaging others' cars for establishing relationships, but you should have several strategies in reserve. Depending on who your "target" is, this could be an offer to meet an interesting person you know or to share some information on a topic important to your contact. Even if you don't possess such information now, you'll certainly find something worthwhile if you search well on the internet or among friends. People rarely say "no" to such non-binding proposals. For them, this may mean a gesture of politeness, but for you it's a valid reason to continue dialogue.

## Consolidate or Lose!

When conversation is finished, your main task is to ensure the next step. We strongly recommend returning to your newly acquired contact within the first 24 or at least first 48 hours after the meeting. We followed a simple rule: whatever happened, we sent reminders the morning after meeting. You need to remind your new interlocutor about yourself before memories of conversation with you fade in their head, especially if they had other meetings that day. In your call or message, definitely mention what aroused the contact's interest and what makes your next interaction logical and justified. For example, your promise to help with something.

As a professional networker, you must create a database of your contacts. And this isn't just a contact list in your phone with names, workplaces, and birth dates. You must be able to record details of your conversations and note progress achieved in relationships, as well as enter data about the past, interests, and peculiarities of your contacts. Subsequently, such things will help you analyze relationships and find the sources of problems if such suddenly arise. At the end of the book, we'll offer a template you can use to create this type of notes. For an operative, such a database is priceless. By the way, we suggest you save contact information on a USB drive rather than on a computer, or even print and store in a safe place. You never know what can happen with phones or computers these days and who will get these priceless notes in case of account hacking!

Corporations have long used specialized Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software of varying complexity. If you like technology and gadgets, you can rent some of these software products as a service for managing your personal network of connections for a relatively small fee.

Oh, and one more thing! Since memories quickly fade—such are the peculiarities of human memory!—there's a probability that in just a few hours many details of conversation will simply be forgotten. Therefore, please get into the habit of making notes while the trail is hot, preferably the same day. Moreover, you need to force yourself to do this even if you're very tired. When you get used to it, such routine won't be a burden; it will become your second nature.

If it seems to you that we're demanding too much from you, compare this with the system created by one of the world's greatest networkers, considered one of the leaders of the "secret world government"—David Rockefeller, who died at age 101. As Joan Lublin writes in the Wall Street Journal, "Mr. Rockefeller recorded contact information and details of each of his meetings with more than 100,000 people from around the world on 3-by-5-inch index cards. In total, he accumulated approximately 200,000 such cards, which were inserted into a Rolodex machine specially built for him. For more than half a century, this 5-foot-tall electronic machine stood in his personal office at Rockefeller Center in New York."

As head of Chase Manhattan Bank and prominent philanthropist, Rockefeller "tracked an endless number of connections with the wealthy and famous, stretching across borders, disciplines, and interests—from fellow business titan Bill Gates to the Shah of Iran, President John Kennedy, Pope John Paul II, and Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on the Moon." "Thanks to this unusual recording system, he could continue conversation with a person he hadn't seen for many years as if their last meeting was last week." "During lunch at his estate in 2015, Mr. Rockefeller gave Mr. Kissinger copies of his 35 Rolodex cards. They contained notes about hundreds of their conversations that had taken place since their first meeting in distant 1955," writes Joan Lublin.

"Mr. Rockefeller understood the importance of contacts during his service in army intelligence abroad during World War II," Lublin continues in her article. "My effectiveness depended entirely on my ability to create a network of people with reliable information. I can quickly figure out the essence of my past relationships with anyone before meeting them again," Mr. Rockefeller wrote in his memoirs in 2002.

What else can be added to this to convince you finally? Fortunately, today there's no point inventing special Rolodexes for such databases. Open a page and dictate—the computer will do the rest. But David Rockefeller's incredible experience once again emphasizes the main idea of our book: if you work on your "ecosystem of connections" purposefully and systematically, networking will become a powerful tool capable of changing your life.

# Chapter 4. Developing Relationships

## Becoming a "Gardener" of Human Relationships

So, the first meeting was successful. Now you're acquainted with each other. But building meaningful relationships is a long path, and here many "minefields" lie in wait for you. As in the desert, you observe mirages from time to time. It seems the new stage in the relationship has almost arrived, but soon you understand that the relationship is still far from its final stage—mutual trust.

In movies, spies use sex, violence, and blackmail to achieve their goals. In real life, a spy's most powerful weapon is closeness and trust. On screen, spies crack safes to obtain certain secrets. In reality, everything is different. Others do this for them—those with whom they've become friends, whom they sympathize with and emotionally empathize with. Those who consider being a friend and helping much more important than guarding someone's secrets. Even people who trade secrets for money or transmit confidential information for some other reason count on trust and emotional support from the spy as a person on whom their well-being and possibly even life depends at the given moment. They must be confident that the person who knows more about them than anyone else will protect their secrets, respect them, and care for them. At the foundation of major successes of all intelligence services, whether we're talking about the famous aristocrats of the "Cambridge Five" who worked for the Soviet Union during World War II or about the chief of the London station of the KGB's First Chief Directorate Oleg Gordievsky, who spied for MI-6, lay relationships of sympathy, empathy, support, and friendship that developed between agents and their handlers. A spy's art lies in building relationships of trust, confidence, and dependence.

Of course, in relationship levels there exists a whole spectrum of gradations and shades from casual acquaintances to close friends. Discussing what happens in the Productivity Circle, we noted that for relationships to lead to important results for you, they don't necessarily have to be very close. Mutual trust is a delicate thing, and it's difficult to achieve with all contacts. However, for relationships to be considered stable and productive, they need to be brought to a certain level. In such a situation, a spy, businessman, or any other networker becomes a kind of "gardener" who "grows" relationships, protecting them from "winds" and "weeds" in hope that someday they'll bear desired fruits.

## Two Stages in Relationships

The process of building relationships consists of two stages. The first stage lasts from first contact until the moment relationships acquire stability. This means there exists an understandable reason for continuing personal communication between people that isn't tied to a specific event or deal. However, by standards of emotional involvement of participants, such relationships aren't necessarily close. At this stage, you can't expect a person to do for you something that would require great effort and especially risk on their part.

The second stage consists of deepening relationships. Now people truly open up to each other and become "accomplices." Accomplices in the sense that they trust each other sufficiently to share personal secrets and take business or personal risks together. Obviously, many relationships won't see the second stage, but the closer they approach the point of mutual trust, the more opportunities they open.

It seems some people are simply created to be together, created to be friends. However, in most friendly relationships, as in marriage, success depends on the parties' efforts as well as their talent. The problem is that the talent for building relationships, like any other talent, is rarely distributed evenly. Even among spies. Some manage to "skim the cream" from a large number of contacts, sacrificing depth, while others know how to "squeeze" maximum depth and result from fewer connections. There are many cases when one officer establishes contact with a potential recruitment candidate and then passes them to a colleague for study and development. Just like hunters and gardeners—each has their own methods and path to success.

Do you have acquaintances who seemingly know everyone and everything but seem incapable of building deep relationships or talking with anyone "heart to heart"? Or maybe you have only a few close friends, but you've known them since childhood and they'll be with you your whole life? You probably already feel which part of the relationship-building process comes easier to you and which skills need work.

Don't equate sophisticated "socialites" with those who know how to effectively develop useful connections. For example, at the beginning of our operative career, we envied people succeeding in "small talk" at parties. We considered this a skill that definitely needed to be mastered to build proper relationships. The ability to support conversations "about nothing" is useful in itself, but as our subsequent experience showed, its importance shouldn't be overestimated. Champions of "small talk" aren't necessarily effective in terms of influencing others. If you want to hold an interlocutor's attention, it's much more useful to learn to ask good questions—people are more likely to express their own opinion than listen to yours. Not being the "most talkative" person at a party is no obstacle at all.

The process of deepening relationships has its own dynamics. You can observe sharp growth in interaction intensity—with daily numerous calls and meetings—but there are also lulls when nothing happens. Problems and misunderstandings may arise whose causes no one can explain. There are good meetings and not so good ones. Being in a relationship is like floating down a river. You'll see the next turn only when you approach it. Holistic analysis of relationship dynamics is more useful than reflections on the success or failure of some individual conversation. Each meeting has its own context, purpose, and mood. In some cases, your partner may falsify their behavior and, misleading you, produce the desired impression. But falsifying the relationship as a whole, of course, won't work.

## Three "Legs" of Relationships

Relationships between people are like a chair—for reliable support they need at least three "legs." The more "legs" your relationships have, the better, but three is that minimum ensuring their survival. The three "legs" are Common Interests, Emotional Empathy, and Common Social Circle. Of course, there are relationships that rest on only two or even one of these three "legs," but they're subject to much greater risk of breaking. How many stories can you recall about happy coexistence of two different worlds in the spirit of "Beauty and the Beast" involving your friends? Most likely, very few. How much time do you spend with people with whom you have not the slightest common business, interests, and compelling reasons for meetings? It can be pleasant to chat with them—but what then?

Common interest in relationships implies the possibility of mutually beneficial exchange, whether material benefits, business ventures, friendly communication, emotional support, or something else. If common interest is unclear, the other two "legs" in relationships are often insufficient to maintain relationships for a long time. People meet less and less often, and the connection between them gradually blurs.

Emotional empathy is mutual affection that promotes "synchronization" of personalities. We're talking about temperament compatibility, similarity of views and experiences. However, such similarity doesn't mean being alike—for those striving for intellectual or interpersonal stimulation, opposites can indeed attract and enrich each other.

Common social circle can be defined in narrow or broad sense. In both variants, they relate to inclusion in a common environment, both professional and purely social. In the narrow sense, it includes your active personal contacts within the Productivity Circle with whom you do business or spend leisure time. In the broader sense, Common Social Circle represents a group of people with the same position in society—by income level, education, or social status. Practical experience shows that people from groups that are socially dissimilar and distanced from each other maintain stable long-term relationships only within some very specific events or projects, say, hunting trips or visits to the bathhouse. As the old saying goes: "Birds of a feather flock together."

## Stabilization and Consolidation of Relationships

Your goal at the very beginning, when establishing relationships, is to introduce a person into your Productivity Circle, strengthen connections so they don't break at the first obstacle. Here the key word is "stability." Usually at the very beginning, the context of relationships is quite specific. Imagine a person agreed to meet you a second time because you promised to introduce them to a venture investor. In this case, your contact sees in you only a path to achieving their specific goal. And even if their startup gets funding, you'll simply be a participant in their relationship with investors. And if they suddenly don't get money, then in their eyes you'll remain "the person with whom they wasted time." That's why your goal is to move this budding relationship from the specific context of investment opportunities to a so-called "neutral" state—a situation when the relationship is no longer tied to a specific deal, event, or promise. What now unites you depends only on what you both like or what you're both doing.

In this sense, the story of Soviet spy Richard Sorge, whom English writer Tom Clancy called "the best spy of all time," deserves attention. Sorge's incredibly friendly manner, charisma, and talent in establishing connections helped him find common language with the most vigilant and difficult people. In 1933, after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Sorge went to Japan under the "legend" of a German journalist who allegedly sympathizes with the Nazi regime. There he met military attaché of the German embassy Eugen Ott, who subsequently became Nazi Germany's ambassador to Imperial Japan. Over time, Sorge managed to transform these initially purely professional contacts between an ambitious official and an interested and obliging reporter into deep personal connections covering all aspects of life, including even a romance with Ott's wife! Ultimately, Ott developed boundless trust in Sorge, becoming for him the main source of critically important information about Japan and Germany's strategy and military plans. The results achieved by Sorge allowed him to occupy a special place in the ranks of great spies.

## "Exchange Currencies" of Relationships

Now it's time to deal with another networking myth. This is the myth of "true friendship." We've heard the opinion that relationships formed with a specific goal, whether business advancement or satisfying one's own ego, are somehow flawed. It's believed that there are either "real" relationships or those in which one party somehow manipulates the other. The idea is that relationships that aren't completely altruistic are actually "fake" and therefore in some sense vicious.

Let's debunk this myth. Practically all connections you have in your Support Circle are devoid of material interest, unless we're talking about some family business. This is natural. However, if you look carefully at your relationships in the Productivity Circle—from very close friends to new acquaintances—you'll understand that, regardless of relationship depth, both you and your vis-à-vis still have a certain reason for communicating with each other, and this reason is connected with some expected benefit. Perhaps this isn't the only, and maybe not even the main reason for maintaining your relationship, but it's present one way or another. When this reason doesn't exist...

*[End of Chunk 7 - Pages 121-140]*


*[Continued from Chunk 7]*

it becomes clear, you'll either understand that the person has entered your Support Circle, or your relationship will gradually weaken. The fact is that friendly relationships aren't divided into "true" and "false." They simply belong to different functional circles and are based on different goals.

Strong relationships are built on the exchange of something valuable. People fear deepening relationships if they don't understand what you might demand of them in the future. At some point, you need to declare your "vision" for the relationship—that is, what you expect from your partner and what you can offer in return. This doesn't apply to the very first meetings, but don't postpone the issue for long—your acquaintance will want to clarify everything anyway. If they don't share your vision, let this become clear sooner rather than later.

Your "declaration of vision" doesn't necessarily have to be expressed in words. Through concrete actions you can convey the message much more effectively. You must constantly search for something valuable for your contacts and actively offer it. When people see that you bring something important to them into the relationship, they'll reciprocate.

Reciprocity is the sine qua non, the necessary condition of any strong relationship. If one party feels they're being taken for granted or as temporary, such a relationship awaits inevitable collapse. The "exchange currency" can be anything—from pleasant time spent together, friendly communication, access to exclusive clubs and mentorship to help with career advancement or access to investment opportunities. You can be confident that everything is fine in the relationship if you know exactly what you're exchanging with your partner and that this exchange is mutually beneficial.

## Three Parameters for Measuring Relationship Dynamics

How do you measure progress in relationships and monitor their dynamics? Track on your contact network map how a person moves from the Development Circle to the Productivity Circle, how the intensity of relationships grows, how they build connections with your friends. Thus, you can assess the stability of your connections and your real progress. Later in the book we'll offer some tools to help you do this. But for now, a bit of theory. Relationships are characterized by a number of parameters that describe what's happening between you and your acquaintance. Let's examine them in turn.

Leadership and dependence characterize the initiative and roles of the parties in interaction. If you initiate contact, it's quite natural to expect that at the first stage you'll find yourself in the position of managing the process. Any role reversal, for example when your contact begins to take initiative by suggesting going somewhere together or calling you first, speaks of interest in you and signifies progress. Relationships in which initiative and leadership remain asymmetric for a long time usually fail, except in cases when roles in the relationship are purely functional or when one person naturally dominates by virtue of their age and experience, for example in professor-student or employer-employee situations.

Communication flows in relationships are another element that needs careful monitoring. Low frequency of communication means the relationship base is unstable—the participants have little to talk about. More frequent communication covering a wide spectrum of topics, especially with increasingly noticeable signs of sincerity, spontaneity, and emotionality, is clear evidence of growing closeness. A good example of maximum communication level is interaction between spouses in a family.

The opposite dynamic, in which communication frequency decreases, should cause you concern: something is going wrong. Exceptions might be close friends or relatives living far from each other. During our intelligence career, we couldn't maintain regular contact with relatives for almost three decades, but they were ready to accept us with open arms at any time.

Emotional involvement and level of mutual trust are also very important parameters of human connections. As mutual understanding between people develops, they empathize and support each other more, demonstrate more emotional openness, more often exchange opinions not only on everyday interests but also on moral, religious, and philosophical questions.

On the scale of personal emotional involvement—the best indicator of the depth and quality of human connections—relationships vary from casual acquaintances and blind dates to lifelong friendship or love. Developing relationships, we strengthen our participation, involvement in another person's life. We not only reduce emotional distance but also expand the range of spheres in which we interact.

As a rule, as relationships deepen, the roles of its participants gradually develop and expand. Let's give a simple example. When you first meet someone, you clearly know what problem brought you together and what role each of you plays. You might be a buyer or seller, intern or trainer. But, for example, in marriage it's difficult to find an area of life that doesn't require your joint participation. You are simultaneously a relative, sexual and business partner...

## "Peaches," "Apples," and "Pomegranates"

The dynamics of relationship development can also vary depending on the nationality of the person you're dealing with. In the period of globalization in business circles, national traits are gradually being erased. However, despite the fact that typical behavior in relationships more often reflects social status than nationality, ethnic and national origin still matters. In the course of our work, we encountered three models of relationship development connected with national characteristics. Let's conditionally call them "peaches," "apples," and "pomegranates."

In the "peach" model, a person easily establishes first contact and willingly develops relationships to the level of a casual acquaintance that obligates nothing. However, then considerable effort and time are required to make them open up and gain trust. To the "touch," such a person resembles a peach: they're very soft, their skin and flesh are easy to pierce, but then you run into something very hard and impenetrable. Most Americans fit this model—they're very friendly and sociable, but at the same time incredible individualists carefully guarding their personal space.

Compared to American "peaches," Russians are more like "pomegranates." They converge with new people with far less enthusiasm, are reserved and cautious at initial stages of relationships. However, once the hard Russian "rind" is pierced, practically no corner will remain closed to you in their soul!

The French, like many other Europeans, usually fall somewhere between "peaches" and "pomegranates"—something like "apples." More reserved than Americans at the initial stage, they prefer not to rush until mutual understanding and trust mature. Nevertheless, some areas—just like apple seeds—will remain hidden and difficult to access.

Of course, the three models described are in pure form a product of our personal experience. Often the dominant role in relationship development is played by the character, motives, and origin of the people with whom you interact.

## How to Maintain Numerous Connections

The necessity of spending much time and emotional energy naturally limits the number of very close connections that can be effectively maintained. This becomes obvious as soon as you draw your functional circles. In the Development Circle, where more distant contacts are located, an ordinary person can have approximately 100 connections; in the Productivity Circle—up to 75 friends and colleagues. In the Support Circle, not counting family members, people rarely have more than three to five very close, intimate friends, not counting relatives. For professionals actively working with people—for example, spies, real estate agents, lawyers, or politicians—the number of connections in the first two circles may well turn out to be twice as many. Virtual contacts on Facebook or LinkedIn will add hundreds of new contacts to your network, but the level of your virtual interaction will remain within the same scheme: you'll still pay significant attention only to a small number of connections.

When you have a hundred people in your network, maintaining contact with them presents no particular difficulty. But what to do when the same politician has to think about thousands of contacts, with almost each of them considering him an important connection and, accordingly, expecting attention? And here once again comes to the fore one of the possibly hackneyed concepts of networking—prioritization. Not all relationships are equal. Their value rises and falls as your life changes, and with it—your tasks. Strategic networking returns us to the necessity of seeing your network from the "bird's eye view" height. This means you'll have to classify your relationships and compile several contact lists with varying degrees of priority.

The first list consists of key relationships on which your career, income, family stability, and most important future plans depend. People from this group deserve regular personal attention from you. That is, for them you must reserve on average one extended meeting at least once a quarter—preferably lunch or dinner—as well as meaningful gifts for birthdays and occasions when you visit them. Additionally, to properly maintain such relationships, you need to plan at least one phone call or electronic message per month, not counting "likes" on their social media posts.

The second list is the complete opposite of the first. It includes people whose relationships can, to put it in not entirely politically correct terms, be "frozen." Little happens in such relationships daily, but when necessary they're easy to revive. Here you can use all the power of virtual social networks. However, a couple of phone calls per year to exchange news and birthday greetings are still mandatory conditions for maintaining such relationships.

In the third list fall those who remained outside the first two—new acquaintances from studies or good friends to whom you feel indebted. Since such relationships are often in development mode, your approach will depend on the stage and purpose of each. Our experience suggests: to stabilize and strengthen established relationships, you'll need 2-3 meetings at which you need to raise issues substantial for each party—with subsequent regular calls and emails touching on the discussed topic as well as personal aspects and interests.

When people meet and friendly relationships develop between them, their communication happens regularly and often. People get used to each other and actively study one another. In their heads they reproduce images of each other, adapting their behavior to the new friend. Over time, mutual understanding strengthens, and time between meetings can increase. For proper maintenance of relationships at the development stage, from two meetings per month to one every two months may be required, depending on the dynamics of emotional involvement. Relationships that are already stable and sufficiently close will quite withstand longer breaks without losing their significance.

## Remote Networking

Years of travel and rich experience moving our "operative base" from one country to another gave us a global network spanning all continents. Maintaining relationships with people on the other end of the world has always been difficult, but in recent years modern means of communication have significantly facilitated this work.

We'd like to emphasize that networking in virtual space and networking in the real world are quite similar things, whatever anyone tells you. Online space is simply an extension of your real network, and the same approaches we've discussed are equally applicable to the latter. Currently used popular platforms and tools may change, but the dynamics of relationships between people and communities remain generally unchanged. From a purely technical point of view, using Myspace for building networks fundamentally doesn't differ from the functioning of such platforms as Instagram or WhatsApp. Therefore, let's focus better on methods and goals rather than tools that constantly change.

Over many years we've noticed that virtual relationships usually fall into the same three stable groups, depending on purpose, frequency of interaction, and emotional closeness. These online groups reflect our Functional Circles. The main thing is to recognize the type of interaction with a person online and coordinate your actions with the overall networking strategy.

The most intensive and close online interaction is usually "reserved" for members of your Support Circle. This happens almost daily. Here you usually have cohesive groups of friends conducting endless dialogue, for example, through group chat. The group is stable because all participants are aware of each other's daily lives. In this case, our personal social "filter" is inactive, and we feel we're part of a mutual "zone of trust." This is precisely how deep interpersonal relationships are cultivated on the internet.

The next type of interactive interaction imitates what happens within the Productivity Circle. These connections, as a rule, are quite purposeful and are maintained by mutually shared and clearly expressed interest. Examples might be book clubs, groups of music fans, auto forums, or even alumni pages. The common theme helps structure interaction and guarantees that everyone will find something interesting to discuss here. The activity of one or another participant may weaken over time, but it's always easy and simple for them to return to the general group. In such groups, excessively close relationships are rarely maintained, but this is a good way to establish regular interaction with other members. You may not even know many members of the online group personally, but they can become a good and reliable source of building connections and useful information.

One example of skillful use of thematic channels in virtual space is the case of Dickson Yeo, a doctoral candidate from Singapore who was apparently recruited by Chinese intelligence. He used his extensive LinkedIn connections to collect information from persons having connections with military and government officials in the United States. At trial, Yeo admitted that he contacted and negotiated with high-ranking officials, using a fake consulting company to post job listings and obtain needed information. With one of his numerous contacts, a US Air Force security specialist, Yeo maintained a five-year dialogue first through LinkedIn and then by phone, periodically requesting various consulting services.

Despite ultimately being detained, Yeo is a good example of how ubiquitous and effective online networks have become. Intelligence services can fully use virtual space if only because they know perfectly well: against the backdrop of millions of business contacts happening on the internet every minute, they can secretly and unhindered recruit new sources.

The third and least frequent case of online interaction is connected with those contacts you might have "frozen" for various reasons for some time: because of the great distance separating you or lack of direct need. Often these are contacts that perhaps were already in your Productivity Circle but gradually moved to its outer edge. You turn to them no more than a couple of times per year. We recommend compiling a list of contacts with whom you'd like to maintain contact and setting several "reminders" in your calendar to get in touch on time and remind them of yourself. It's useful to keep records of what was discussed last time to somehow demonstrate your care and interest in the other party. Fortunately, the task is made easier: you can review chat logs. Interaction at this level usually takes the form of a video or phone call or a long electronic message in which you can touch on important events that have occurred since the last contact.

Before the whole world went headlong into the internet, people used greeting cards in such cases, which they exchanged during holidays. In them they reported the latest significant events of their lives. In our case, the goal is not to let your contacts irrevocably "drift away." They should be close enough that you don't feel awkward if out of the blue you ask for some favor. Try to speak openly about personal matters or current problems—and you'll be surprised how easily they'll reciprocate. To compensate for the deficit in communication frequency, it's necessary to give your messages greater "depth," make them as open and personal as possible, if not "philosophical."

The simplest thing you can do on the internet or by phone is remind your friends that you're aware of important events in their lives, such as, for example, their birthdays or their children's birthdays. Modern technologies allow easy tracking of significant dates, but you yourself must pick up the phone or write something. No one will do this for you. A good first step might be birthday reminders on Facebook, but if you go a bit further, it's desirable to remember other important events in your circle's life. This will help you somehow stand out in other people's consciousness. For a serious networker, each such date provides an opportunity to attract people to themselves. If you diligently note facts from the family and professional life of your contacts, as well as their wishes and preferences that they share with you, you'll accumulate a mass of useful assets that can be used to create and strengthen positive attitudes toward yourself.

In the virtual world, the icon with your photo on various sites is the only image by which other people judge you. That's precisely why you should carefully think through creating the right profile on social networks. If it's difficult to discern your human qualities from it, understand what you like and don't like, if it seems made up and fake, people will reluctantly make contact and you'll miss the opportunity to transfer relationships from the virtual world to the real one.

It's easy to abuse virtual communications. Just one click—and your message is sent to hundreds of people. To you personally it may seem original and instructive, but it's possible that your friends are receiving this not for the first time. We're all swamped with hackneyed jokes, countless kitten photos, and copies of email correspondence between people we don't even know. So that your contacts don't unsubscribe and delete such correspondence due to wasted time, we recommend sending your virtual friends only those things they really need and find interesting. Don't forget the wise advice: treat others the same way you'd like to be treated yourself!

Currently everyone is dominated by the problem of personal "marketing." It's enough to look at the online profile of some "influencer" to understand how effective personal branding can become. We recommend you focus efforts on making your profile attractive to people you want to attract. Don't try to please everyone and everything. Given the incredible size of online space, we strongly recommend a more targeted approach. Once you establish yourself and your image, work on moving relationships from the Development Circle to the Productivity Circle. Soon you'll discover that your digital life becomes a useful continuation of everyday life. It will serve as a kind of multiplier of your usual networking efforts.

# Chapter 5. Methods for Strengthening Relationships

Now our discussion of building relationships moves from general, strategic principles to tactics and tools. What can be done to strengthen and deepen connections? As the person primarily interested in these relationships, you need to take initiative and determine what, where, and how should happen. You yourself are responsible for actions that will bring you closer to others. Below we'll offer some methods for strengthening relationships.

The essence of relationship development lies in the gradual erasure of barriers between people. The mentioned barriers are differences in emotional state, social position, lifestyle, origin, political views, and so on. As your connections strengthen and emotional involvement grows, such differences will have less and less influence on the stability of your relationships. If you want to develop relationships, you need to demonstrate that no differences will affect your friendship. And in most cases you won't be asked to betray your convictions: if you remain true to yourself, people will respect you even more.

## Open Yourself to Another

The first method of erasing interpersonal barriers consists in opening up and telling about yourself. Usually this helps another person do the same, thereby bringing relationships to a new level of trust. However, opening up sometimes means exposing your doubts and weaknesses. The first step is associated with risk, but this risk is justified. We always want to show ourselves from the best side, make an impression of a successful person. We usually hide our problems and failures. But everyone else does the same. Throwing dust in people's eyes, we make others envious and provoke competition that kills sincerity in relationships. A drop of imperfection and vulnerability won't hurt you at all; on the contrary, it will help remove the barriers separating you. There's no point in somehow surpassing the other party. Your goal isn't to impress but, above all, to attract!

Deep relationships necessarily mean openness in those areas most important to each person—family, health, money, and children. If your interaction includes communication with family members, discussion of hobbies, health and financial issues, debates about the best ways to educate children, then know: you're on the right path to mutual trust. Therefore, as soon as you feel stability in the relationship, take initiative and transfer part of your communication to the above-mentioned topics.

A good way to assess progress in building trusting relationships is to find out whether your connections are capable of talking about their weaknesses and failures. We—like everyone else—have such "goods" in abundance. When the right moment comes, try to do this first and see if the person reciprocates. Joint problem-solving significantly deepens relationships. At the same time, this gives you the opportunity to help, and if such help is accepted, then to address a similar request yourself later.

## Expand the Sphere of Interaction

Discussing the question of how to strengthen new relationships, we emphasized that a very positive factor might be including new connections in your social environment, membership in the same professional organization, or living in the same neighborhood. Common acquaintances and identical impressions—in short, seeing the world from the same point of view—create a sense of belonging and camaraderie. However, to develop stronger relationships, you can't always move to another place or change professions. Fortunately, there are other things that can be done to achieve this goal.

You can include your spouse or girlfriend in these relationships—or even your children. Even if your acquaintance is single, interaction with you in a new, broader context will certainly be beneficial. You'll see your contact in a new setting and in a somewhat different light, as if provoking them to new interactions. This will allow you to reveal sides of their personality hidden by the social roles you both took on in previous meetings. For example, observing a person at meetings and on business trips won't help you understand what kind of husband or father they are. Additionally, your spouse or partner will provide you with a fresh pair of eyes, noticing things you might miss.

For spies, a second pair of eyes is an invaluable opportunity to assess the true level of closeness and sincerity in relationships. Introducing your contact to a new person from your inner circle will allow the other to ask questions or raise the same topics from a different angle.

Let's recall a story that happened during our work in the United States. One of us met a financial consultant of Chinese origin. He worked at a technology firm that was of interest to us. For us, this person could become a good source of information, so a decision was made to try to establish closer relations with him. However, for a long time the relationship remained quite cold and formal. All attempts to move conversations beyond business topics were ignored. Given his Chinese origin, we suspected that building a stronger connection would require more time. However, the absence of any progress overall was alarming.

As a last chance, we invited him and his wife to dinner. This was an excellent opportunity for both of us to look at the couple in a relaxed setting and try to better understand the situation. After several drinks and an informal conversation between the women in the kitchen, it became clear that in this Chinese family it was the wife who played the main role. The husband expected his wife's approval in almost everything. We decided that to strengthen the relationship between the men, it was necessary to strengthen the connection between their female "halves." The next several months were spent establishing contact with his wife, gradually bringing both families closer. It's clear that without a pair of attentive female eyes and teamwork, deep relationships with this person wouldn't have worked out.

When you include a new person in your circle of friends, you indirectly tie them to yourself. They'll establish connections with people who like you and trust you. Each of them will project your positive image onto the newcomer, strengthening their desire to trust you and be closer. From this moment, breaking with you will mean, in essence, breaking relationships with the entire group. And don't forget: each person from your circle becomes a source of additional information about the new contact.

## Provide Help and Support

One of the most valuable "currencies" in relationships is encouragement and support. We always experience a deficit of kind words and understanding: after almost forty years of marriage, we still reproach each other for not receiving this in sufficient quantity. A compliment is a powerful "drug" for building relationships: people yearn to hear something pleasant about themselves. But a compliment should under no circumstances turn into flattery.

Mutual assistance is a good building "brick" of trust. If you know that your friend or colleague has a problem and might need help, don't hesitate to offer it. In the worst case, your offer will be politely declined. But the very fact will certainly be remembered!

Working in intelligence, we discovered an interesting paradox. Many believe that asking for help will necessarily harm relationships, that in such a situation you look weak and dependent. People don't like to appear weak and dependent, fear provoking bewilderment and rejection from the other party. In reality, everything is exactly the opposite. When you, demonstrating some vulnerability, ask for help, you place the person in a position where they can demonstrate strength and capabilities, thereby raising their status in their own eyes. However, there's one nuance. You can safely ask only for what your acquaintance can do without great effort. This is especially true in the early stages of relationships, when connections are still weak and can be easily broken by any misunderstanding. When people ask for and offer help to each other, their relationships become closer. Nothing surprising, because each of you begins to participate more actively in each other's lives.

As soon as you're offered help, you become a kind of debtor. This will give you the opportunity to thank the person with some surplus. They might tell you later: "Oh, you shouldn't have!" but at the same time will be glad that, on one hand, you didn't forget their kindness, and on the other, that they even extracted some benefit from it. From now on you'll be considered a reliable, honest, and pleasant person. Hence the rule when asking for help, which will serve as an effective tool for building connections: ask for little, but thank generously.

We suggest you assess your qualities, experience, and connections and compile a list—a kind of "catalog" of what you're ready to share. The catalog might include professionals you can recommend to other people, for example your friend who's a chiropractor. Do you like running, are you into ornithology or origami? Share your skills and passion with someone. Even if this doesn't "hook" anyone, you'll make an impression as an interesting person and might be recommended to other people. Therefore, don't be afraid to give more than you receive. If you set yourself the goal of making others happier and more successful, don't doubt: they'll respond in kind.

## Organize Lunches and Parties

An interesting fact: most substantive conversations happen precisely at the table. If you need to quickly discuss something, we say: "Let's go have coffee." A serious business issue will certainly require a "business lunch"! To thank someone for a service, we suggest a joint dinner. In a relaxed atmosphere (often having drunk plenty of alcohol) you push your partners to open up and become closer.

That's why you as a networker extremely need to develop the skills of a party and dinner organizer. Not all of us are born conversationalists and "party people." At the beginning of our career, we weren't either. Mastery comes with experience. However, there's always a way out. At first, invite a talkative friend who'll take on the role of a kind of "toastmaster."

When deciding whether to go to a party or come up with some excuse, the main question, as always, sounds the same: who else will be there? The success of an event depends on the optimal combination of its participants. The rules here are quite simple. First, it's desirable that most people know and like each other. This will create excitement and necessary "warm-up." Second, a reasonable balance of men and women, married and single, locals and visitors is necessary—so that no one gets bored. The third rule: you can invite several new faces, but no more than a quarter of the total. This ratio will bring fresh dynamics to communication but at the same time help avoid awkward pauses. And fourth, it's desirable to acquire some "star guest"—an interesting storyteller, a person of high status, or simply invite a friend who just returned from a trip to Tibet...

## Create a Positive Atmosphere

Necessary prerequisites for good relationships are your positivity, openness, and confidence. The task is simple—create a light, positive atmosphere. People should enjoy being in your company. Any negativity or criticism immediately lowers the "temperature" of your interaction.

Praise and a compliment to the person with whom you're building a relationship is one of the surest ways to create positive feelings in them toward you. We know perfectly well how effectively flattery exploits the brain's need for positive "reinforcement." However, a spy must act very carefully in this territory. Spies are fixated on working with smart people, and a smart person will recognize insincere flattery even if deep down they like it. As soon as you're caught using such crude tools, the level of trust in your relationships will fall. For praise to be effective, you need to know real achievements, positive character traits, or a person's actions. The same applies to compliments, whether about a beautiful tie or fresh appearance after vacation.

Above all, you must be sincere and truthful. Don't pretend nothing happened if, for example, you got into an accident on the way to a meeting. Simply explain and reschedule for another time. You might even get a bonus in the form of sympathy and an offer of help, which in itself is one of the "bricks" of relationships.

---

## Help Others Open Up

The atmosphere in which relationships form depends on how well convergence happens on an emotional level. This can't be achieved if people aren't made to talk. And conversely: when your friend starts talking, they share their emotions. In such cases, you as if become part of them. Remember that as an active listener, you yourself are the driving force of conversation.

You can direct the topic of conversation in the right direction, but on condition that your gestures and posture also express genuine interest. With the right questions, you can shift the focus of conversation so that the person doesn't feel they're being led in some particular direction. For her or him, the course of conversation will seem quite natural. Leading conversation through questions is like redirecting water flow: either by laying channels or building dams.

Moving conversation from one topic to another, you get more chances to obtain information about your partner than if you asked about it directly. Direct questions, especially arising outside the context of conversation, will most likely be ignored or rejected. Hence the advice: train yourself not to ask direct questions at all and not to ask so-called "closed questions"—that is, those that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." Open questions should begin with phrases like "How do you feel about...", giving the person the opportunity to formulate the answer as they wish, without setting any boundaries for reflection. By providing such freedom to the speaker, you can learn more about their interests and motivation.

## Do Something Interesting Together

As soon as you understand someone's priorities and interests, you can use one of the most effective relationship-building tools—spending time together—doing what you both enjoy. Nothing opens another person to you like, for example, a joint trip and new impressions. Moreover, you don't need to watch the latest Hollywood film about buddy cops to understand this. We already know that the most heartfelt conversations happen while fishing or during soccer matches with our children participating.

Several years ago, an acquaintance called me and suggested going fishing. Fishing, honestly speaking, isn't my element, and our relationship wasn't that close. Moreover, I suspected that by calling me out of the blue after several months of silence, this person was counting on some favor. In general, at first I wanted to refuse, but not having better plans for the weekend, I still agreed, hoping to distract myself from the summer city heat in nature. By the time we got to the fishing spot, the weather had deteriorated: it became overcast, strong wind blew. And by evening thunder crashed and rain fell. In short, the fishing didn't work out. In the evening, when the rain stopped, we were soaked through and built a fire to dry our clothes. To warm up better, we uncorked a bottle of whiskey, and spent the next several hours in conversation—first about our misadventures with the weather, then about almost everything—about our lives, family problems, children. Was this the best outing in my life? Of course not. But it turned out definitely unforgettable. And new impressions and shared experience in one fell swoop strengthened our relationship in one leap.

## How to Prepare Productive Meetings

A spy's task isn't just to build relationships but to build them quickly and efficiently. That's why a spy must get maximum from any interaction. Every meeting conducted by an operative worker must be carefully, sometimes down to the smallest details, planned and prepared. Therefore, if you want to achieve better results in communicating with people, you can use the same approach that representatives of our profession use.

At each meeting you pursue two goals simultaneously—advancing the relationship and deepening your understanding of the partner. In reality, relationship development and improvement of mutual understanding are merely two sides of the same coin that mutually reinforce each other. Preparing for a meeting, you must determine for yourself exactly how you'll achieve both of the set goals.

Developing productive exchanges is the best way to strengthen connections. Such a "give and take" process happens between people constantly, consciously or unconsciously. By making exchanges more thoughtful and purposeful, you can significantly improve relationships. That's why before each meeting, think through what you can offer and what you can ask for.

Finally, you need to plan subsequent steps in relationships. After all, you want your future meetings to proceed under better conditions—and with better results!

To help with meeting planning, we offer a fairly simple table that we ourselves used in our work with agents. Filling out the table at first glance may seem tedious or even difficult, but such preparatory work will force you to think purposefully about the upcoming conversation and seek non-trivial solutions. This is a kind of training in mental discipline that guarantees your time won't be wasted. Once you get used to planning meetings in advance, you yourself will feel awkward going to them unprepared. But perhaps the most important thing is different: your preparedness for conversation will be appreciated and rewarded by your counterparties, who also value their time!

## Diagnosing Problems in Relationships

Relationship development doesn't follow a straight line. Any relationships can encounter obstacles. Even with the best intentions, you won't be able to avoid all pitfalls and neutralize all mines. The radar you used for scanning people at the first meeting—the "OIS" sorting principle (Dangerous? Interesting? Difficult?)—should never be turned off. In some cases, relationships will be interrupted by your counterparties; in others you yourself will cease communication due to lack of progress and points of contact. To avoid serious problems, we must act like doctors. We need to honestly diagnose diseases in relationships as they appear. That's why your "virtual GoPro camera" must always be on so you can detect roughness or flaws in communication in time.

One of the warning signals is a change in commitment to relationship development from your connection. This can manifest in attempts to limit interaction by reducing its intensity—multiple rescheduling of meetings, refusal to answer calls or messages. From time to time you hear excuses and promises to get in touch, but overall the same picture persists. Usually we hope that such problems are temporary in nature, but most often this isn't the case. In the absence of any fault on your part, such behavior from the other person means that communication with you isn't their main priority. Instead of allowing the problem to drag on, we suggest directly discussing this issue with your contact. By sincerely asking such a question, you lose nothing, but the answer may reveal an error on your part that you didn't see before. If so, then the problem can be corrected.

Another warning sign is lack of initiative in interaction. At a more advanced stage of relationships, reciprocity can be used as a kind of litmus test. If at the first stage of relationship development some passivity from the partner can be justified, then a situation in which initiative always remains with you and your vis-à-vis shows no desire to call first testifies that something went wrong. In our operative history there was a case we long discussed between ourselves. One of our potentially interesting contacts never showed initiative, and we almost forcibly dragged him to meetings. However, at meetings he was very talkative and full of enthusiasm. He clearly enjoyed such conversations, which stretched for many hours, but then again disappeared without a trace for several weeks. After long debates, we came to the conclusion that the person was simply bored and was using us to somehow entertain himself. We decided not to call him anymore and turned out to be right—he never contacted us again.

If a person who showed no desire to develop relationships suddenly wants to activate them, it's quite likely that you don't know something about them. In the best case, it may turn out they want to "sell" you something. We note that for spies, such sudden interest can't help but cause wariness: there's serious danger that someone directed them to you. In our case, that's exactly how it was...

Besides the two mentioned signs of impending problems in relationships, you must also monitor the level of emotional involvement and growth of mutual openness and trust. If a person, despite all your efforts, doesn't want to open up, there's a probability that your personalities conflict and the person will never take a liking to you. They may seem polite, will even encourage you at every opportunity—but the relationship will reach a dead end. For example, if an American never invites you home, there's no trust there whatsoever. By the way, Europeans may have a valid reason to avoid this: many apartments in old European cities are quite small to comfortably receive guests.

One way to test whether a relationship has a future is to describe some problem that worries you and ask for help. As we mentioned earlier, you need to ask only for what a person can do without allocating much time or resources. The reaction usually shows their true face.

So, it's difficult to judge the "health" of relationships by some individual interaction—pleasant or not so much. Relationships depend on many factors. They can go up or down, or stall in place. Nevertheless, if you carefully monitor dynamics and track warning signs, you'll most likely be able to revive most problematic relationships.

To track relationship dynamics, you can use the table provided below. It as if measures the "atmosphere" of relationships by four key factors—commitment to relationship development and intensity, initiative and reciprocity, emotional involvement, openness and trust. Values can vary from 0 to 3 (0—absence, 3—maximum possible). After each meeting, evaluate the four factors according to your impressions. Looking at the numbers you'll see in the table after several meetings with a person, you can more objectively assess how your relationships are developing.

We advise from time to time—maybe once a month or so—opening a bottle of wine or settling comfortably with a cup of tea and conducting a "debriefing." Analyzing the dynamics of your interactions with other people, ask yourself where exactly your relationships are now, what the problems and opportunities are, and what your "flight plan" should be for the next period. You must try to clearly imagine what exactly is holding back your relationships and what strengthens them. Assess the state of your connections with each of your key contacts: are you comfortable with each other, do you meet mutual expectations? Are these relationships even alive? Ask yourself what needs to be done to fix communication problems, or, if this doesn't work out, whether you should reduce the time you devote to them. If such debriefing is conducted regularly, it will stop taking much time but will bring order and clarity to your head.

**Table: Relationship Dynamics**

For someone who views networking in the context of a conveyor of business opportunities, the question of eliminating problems in relationships becomes a problem of "industrial scale." Just as a military surgeon faced with a large flow of seriously wounded is forced to make a decision about whom he'll operate on first and who, in essence, is doomed to death, a spy, politician, or sales manager must decide which relationships need to be strengthened at any cost and which to abandon.

The decision to consolidate or terminate contact can have consequences for your other connections. Each contact is connected to many others. Tracking all interdependencies and thinking through the consequences of your decisions in advance is hardly possible without visualizing your entire complex set of contacts. And here your network map will be useful again.

We return again to the main idea underlying strategic networking. Communicating with people is probably the most exciting but at the same time the most difficult process in the world. Mistakes and failures are inevitable here. You'll never achieve your goal 100%. But if, using a thoughtful, systematic approach, you achieve even 70%, this will still be significantly better than the maximum 20-30% that can be achieved relying on intuition or luck alone.

# Chapter 6. "Penetration" into Organizations

Economists distinguish microeconomics, which studies enterprise behavior, and macroeconomics, which deals with the functioning of the economy as a whole. Taking such an approach as a basis, we can divide networking, accordingly, into micro- and macro-networking. Micro-networking is focused on developing connections with a specific person, from first contact to close friendship. Macro-networking is about managing connections with an entire organization and strengthening one's position in society. Regardless of who you are—an employee working with a client company, a manager appointed to a new department, or a person planning a career in politics—it's extremely important to become an insider in an organization or raise your own status in the group with which you work.

Organization is a quite broad concept. It encompasses everything from an army unit to a volunteer group for studying foreign languages. In an organization or in any structured group, relationships with one person can't be completely separated from relationships with everyone else. Perhaps it would be an exaggeration to say that an organization acts as one team, but nevertheless it has its own rules of internal interaction that we can't ignore or change.

---

## "Deciphering" Organizations

The main distinguishing feature in organizations is the degree of hierarchy. In vertical organizations, the degree of hierarchy is absolute—a higher position automatically gives you power over all subordinate employees, and at the same time better access to information that flows predominantly from above. The antipode of a hierarchical organization is "horizontal." In its extreme variant, this is a group without any structure where all members are equal. In reality, the structures of almost all organizations you encounter are mixed, that is, they combine both vertical and horizontal elements.

The complex of relationships in an organization depends on the formal and informal power of people within it. Formal power consists of the authority given by a person's official position, their relationship to tasks performed by the organization, as well as their place in key organizational processes and access to resources. In turn, informal power is a combination of a person's will and charisma, their competence, external attractiveness, and, to a significant degree, the capabilities of their personal network of contacts.

In an organization we observe the interaction of three different sets of relationships—bureaucratic, power-based, and personal. Bureaucratic relationships reflect official management structures. For example, a person officially occupying the position of department head can issue a bonus or give a reprimand, thereby forcing employees subordinate to them to fulfill certain requirements. Power relationships are only indirectly connected with such formal structures within organizations. They reflect strength of character, experience, personal authority, and social connections—someone's ability to influence other people. Many managers by virtue of their age and experience "radiate" more power than their position gives them. Power relationships also exist between senior and junior team members formally at the same level. Personal relationships stem from human feelings existing between people in the organization—this is love and respect, hatred and fear, friendship and competition.

Since we're focused on relationships between people, questions of power and management are of decisive importance. It's necessary to understand how organizations actually function, regardless of what's written in their official documents. That's precisely why we must distinguish formal and real power structures written on paper and real decision-making processes. Formal management structures often don't reflect the real distribution of power within organizations, whether global business corporations or local charitable foundations. For example, a charitable organization may be led by the spouse of a business magnate formally occupying the position of deputy director for event organization, while its official head, a former minister, appears in public only a couple of times a year.

It's impossible to work effectively with any organization without understanding its real power dynamics. You'll simply give people the opportunity to throw dust in your eyes. The essence of our advice is as follows: assume nothing about the power structure in an organization and consider it a "black box" until you carefully study it.

Against the backdrop of formal structures in organizations, power groups tacitly exist that compete among themselves for the right to make decisions and control resources—personnel policy and budgets. Their strength rests on networks of personal connections of group members and the influence of their leaders, as well as on the ability of such a group to unite against others, master information and resources, and maximally use their personal relationships.

It's important to note that power in organizations belongs to groups, not individuals. It's the trust of group members in each other and their collective control over the organization's vital activity that ensure preservation of their common power. If a person tries to control an organization alone, even being at its very top, they're constantly at risk. The fact is that a group of subordinates can unite to limit the power of an "arrogant" boss and at the same time win more control for themselves. Most often the boss either tries to act on the principle of "divide and rule," setting groups of subordinates against each other, or personally heads the dominant group.

## How to Draw an Organization Map

Having an organization map will be a lifesaver for you, and you won't drown in the complexity of its power dynamics. Such a map will differ greatly from its formal organizational chart because, in addition to functional structure, it will also reflect real power relationships. Its basic graphic elements—people and connections—will be analogous to those used in your personal contact network map, however, special emphasis should be placed on depicting functional and power groups.

Due to the internal complexity of most enterprises and political organizations, representing them as two-dimensional graphs isn't easy. Any picture we draw will be only a rough approximation of the multidimensional relationships that exist in reality. As with your personal contact network, an acceptable picture of the organization will appear not immediately but only after several unsuccessful attempts to capture and simplify it. Don't despair—without such a picture, understanding what's happening is even harder! So, let's, as before, follow this process step by step.

**Stage 1**

In the center of a white sheet of paper, draw a small circle. It will represent the center of power in the organization. Later you'll place several dots or small circles in it representing people who make key decisions. Sometimes it may seem there's only one person who dominates the organization and "deserves" a place in the center circle. Well, so be it. Around the central circle, draw another—with a larger radius. It will be filled with other, less important "bigwigs." After this, you can draw a final outer circle that outlines the outer boundaries or organization in which all other people will be located.

**Stage 2**

From the central point of your drawing, draw lines to the outer circle that will divide the organization into key sectors—business units or functional divisions such as finance department, marketing department, research and development department. Each of the sectors, in turn, can also be divided into component parts.

**Stage 3**

Using dots or small circles, designate key figures in the organization according to their positions and functions. For example, the head of the finance department will be placed in the finance sector, but according to their real capabilities, they may or may not fall into the central circle of "bigwigs." Once you place all key figures on the map, connect them with lines or arrows representing the direction, quality, and intensity of their relationships, just as on your personal contact map.

**Stage 4**

And finally, as a last but certainly no less important step, it's necessary to identify competing power groups in the organization. Such often semi-secret alliances can, at least partially, be discerned after careful analysis of relationships between key decision-makers. Their closeness is hinted at not by direction or intensity but rather by the quality of relationships. The most reliable information about who's on whose team will come from your sources who themselves are insiders in the company. To designate people's belonging to various power groups, color them with different colors or circle these groups with colored lines.

Once you have a map, use it to prepare your strategy. As with personal networks, find out which of your contacts are close to the real "bigwigs," who can become your "connectors," sources of information, "gatekeepers," and "bridges."

## How to Pave a Path into an Organization

If even in relationships with an individual person a thoughtful, strategic approach is important, then when it comes to such complex nodes of human interconnections as organizations, here it plays a key role. You must ask yourself what you want from this or that organization or company and who can give you what you desire. Do you want to become an exclusive supplier? Do you want to be hired for a job? Do you want ultimately a strategic alliance with your business? Or maybe you want the organization to contribute to your charitable foundation?

Our goal: to offer you recommendations that will help build necessary relationships in the organization with fewer mistakes. They may seem intuitively clear, but their proper implementation will require some experience and persistence. And here creating a network map that shows who's who in the organization will help you thoughtfully plan your approach. As you progress, the map will help preserve your deeper knowledge about key "connection nodes" and power centers so that later you can pave paths to the right people.

Using already familiar networking terms, you'll most likely enter the organization through a "bridge," that is, a person you met at some conference or through a friend of a friend. However, the primary and very urgent task is to, regardless of the first, find another, additional "bridge" into the company. It's known that not all relationships will work as intended. It's possible that relationships with the person who brought you here will also be interrupted and this imaginary "door" will close. Moreover, it's quite likely that this person will want to control your relationships with their organization or even extract some benefit from this. If you build stronger relationships with someone else, they'll most likely react with envy and displeasure. After all, for them all other employees in this organization are—in a certain sense—competitors.

Obviously, to acquire an additional "bridge," you'll need time. At first you simply don't have sufficient information about the organization. That's why the second most important task is to use the initial contact to get to "capacitors." That is, to real insiders who know how the organization functions and how real power is distributed. We hope these people will be able to provide you with enough information to help avoid involvement in conflicts of various competing groups. If you're taken as a tool of one of them, this will greatly limit your future opportunities...

*[Continued from Chunk 10]*

The search for additional "bridges," being a priority at the initial stage, in no way prevents you from using for your own interests other people you encounter within the organization. The basic principles of network development, such as searching for "connectors," "capacitors," and "conductors," remain in force. As "conductors" in this case, you can consider those who can bring you to specific company departments—the procurement department, research and development department, or company divisions in other cities.

Not all employees of an organization are equally important for achieving set goals. Your ultimate goal: reach those who influence the decisions you need. After initial contacts are secured and your presence in the company is ensured, your next step is identifying centers of real power and searching for influential figures. These aren't necessarily those at the top of the organizational structure. Moreover, often direct contact with the highest decision-makers can lead to problems. You'll most likely become the object of attacks from all those who are also fighting for their time and attention.

What criteria can be used to search for people needed to strengthen your influence in an organization? Such people should:

• exert unambiguous influence on decision-making in the organization;
• be "insiders" directly connected with the main power groups;
• have potential for further growth in the organization;
• be ready to develop close personal relationships with you.

The last point is extremely important: if a person is incompatible with you by character, if they don't like you, if they don't listen to your advice, all you can do, despite the power this person possesses, is use them as an occasional source of information.

In searching for influential figures, you should in every way cultivate "capacitors" who can perform the role of your personal "guides." Such people keep in memory the entire chronology of the organization's development. They remember who made successful and unsuccessful decisions, who implemented prestigious or failed projects, who played on whose side and why exactly these people ended up in top management positions. The more such "guides" you have, the better you understand what's really happening and where everything is moving.

Once you understand how everything really works, you'll have a chance to yourself become an intermediary for transmitting information within the company and an influencer. I once met several managers working with large corporate clients who served as reliable conductors of information and new ideas in their client organizations. They claimed to know these client organizations even better than the clients themselves. Don't be surprised: in companies there are often many internal communication barriers and taboos that can only be violated by outsiders. As soon as organization employees see you as a channel for transmitting important messages within the company or up to its management, you can say that now you've truly achieved your goal and become an insider.

From our experience working in an international business consulting firm that served as "cover" for intelligence activities, we can recall several "working group" sessions designed to help transnational semiconductor companies increase chip sales to major smartphone manufacturers. For these projects, both sides gathered global teams that included representatives from research and development departments, logistics chains, manufacturing, and other business units working on launching new products. Observing the interaction of the team leader from the seller's side—an international client manager of the semiconductor company, a cheerful and good-natured Italian—it was impossible to understand whose side he was on—seller or buyer. During negotiations, he sat on the client's side. In the course of exchanging opinions with client employees, he discussed details of product development programs about which, judging by their surprised reaction, even prominent members of the client team had no idea. Moreover, this client manager later admitted that the client company's management regularly turned to him for help in finding new employees...

## Decision-Making Styles

Perhaps you want the organization to make certain decisions favorable to you and your business. However, possible strategies for building contacts and strengthening your own influence will strongly depend on the decision-making style in the organization.

Decision-making styles depend on the balance of power in the organization and on the influence of various groups on the process of appointing managers or selecting suppliers. Some sectors of the company may fall under the influence of various competing stakeholder groups. For example, one group may de facto block some strategic decisions through their key appointee who occupies the position of vice president of finance. Similarly, groups can control each other by appointing their employees to important governing bodies such as, for example, the procurement committee.

Despite various mechanisms of power and regardless of management level, methods of decision-making in organizations, as a rule, fall under three styles. The first assumes the presence of a main decision-maker, sometimes even a monopolist on decision-making—a "tsar." For victory, it's usually enough to convince such a "tsar" to personally support (lobby for) a decision favorable to you. Obviously, in this case your organizational strategy should be aimed at reaching the key figure and influencing them.

The second style is when a decision is made by a committee consisting of representatives of various functions and very often competing power groups. Having convinced one or several members of such a committee, even the most high-ranking and influential, you'll hardly achieve anything if some members oppose your proposal. Here, unlike the case with the "tsar," your calculation isn't to attract active supporters but rather not to make enemies. To achieve this goal, all committee members must view you as independent and impartial, not connected with any of the competitors.

The third style—"bureaucratic"—refers to the case when there's actually no single clear decision-making instance, whether "king" or "committee." The decision becomes the result of a lengthy bureaucratic process when any proposal is considered in stages according to various criteria, that is, practically no one takes personal responsibility for the decision as a whole. Such a nightmarish scenario is increasingly observed in large companies and government organizations, requiring enormous expenditures of time, effort, and nerves from all parties. From a networking point of view, this is the most difficult case, since it requires deep knowledge of the organization in terms of both processes and personalities on the path of decision-making. It's no surprise that only a few "privileged" suppliers can assemble a rich library of personal contacts and experience working with the organization to continue successfully conducting business in such a business environment.

For example, when it comes to government or military procurement in the United States, there are now extremely few contractors who can figure out—not to mention then comply with!—the details of tender documents that list all Congressional requirements. Thus, the only chance for an average company to get a piece of the tasty "pie" is to become a subcontractor to such giants as Boeing or Booz Allen Hamilton, who take a fat margin from contractors and maintain control over clients. And where does Boeing know how to satisfy its clients' requests? Very simply: by hiring former generals—Pentagon insiders!

## How to Take a Place in the Leader's Mind

Now it's time to discuss another important skill of a good networker—understanding the mindset and needs of the decision-maker you need and using appropriate vocabulary. In other words, it's necessary to be on the same wavelength, speak the same language, and see the world through the eyes of the decision-maker.

In our personal experience, chances for establishing relationships will inevitably dry up if you misinterpret the mentality and needs of decision-makers, don't fit into their priorities, and, accordingly, incorrectly explain what you want from them. The reasons are simple: decision-makers are endlessly attacked by flows of people seeking their attention, and they don't want to waste their time. To somehow survive under the influx of affairs and visitors, they've learned to treat all incoming requests like tennis balls—that is, automatically delegate as many such issues as possible to other people, leaving for themselves only those few that interest them personally. Such interest arises when information that lands on their desk can potentially bring them personal benefit—of material, career, or other order.

In business, this looks roughly like this. Imagine you're a sales manager at an IT integrator. And now, finally, you've been appointed a meeting with the head of the international logistics department of a large corporation. How would you position yourself to build productive relationships?

You might talk about updating the system that manages inventory. In this case, there's a high probability that your object will "toss the ball" to their subordinate—the director of the information technology department. You might also propose conducting a detailed audit of corporate IT systems with the goal of implementing best practices. Hearing such a proposal, your potential partner will most likely redirect the "ball" to a higher level in their organization, responding that the question should be addressed to the corporation's chief operating officer. In both cases, your chance of returning to conversation with the head of the international logistics department and establishing direct working relationships with them becomes negligible.

To remain at the level of the decision-maker with whom you want to develop relationships, and so you won't be "kicked" up or down, you need to understand how to become useful for solving specific problems faced by this manager. This is unlikely to happen without the participation of corporate insiders. Imagine such a situation: you learned that the head of the international logistics department is waging a battle against the company's regional branches, which have long wanted the opportunity to independently choose information technology suppliers. In such a situation, a timely proposal to implement new security functions throughout the organization will help your object in the fight against rivals, giving them good arguments for preserving their control over branch decisions. And at the same time will ensure you a place as a valuable ally and even friend.

## Tuning Channels of Influence

We hope your plans related to this or that organization aren't limited only to pressing problems. There's no point spending months and especially years of your precious time on developing relationships if you don't have long-term plans for influencing future corporate decisions. But if such plans exist, then you'll have to build special relationships with two types of people in the organization.

The first type is "visionaries" who determine the company's future. Usually they can be found among such people as the chief technology officer, head of the marketing department, or manager of new products. Each in their own capacity and all together they determine where the organization will move.

The other type is "rising stars." These are people who will most likely be in power tomorrow but are still accessible today. They're not yet surrounded by a "cordon sanitaire" of deputies and assistants and haven't yet become a target for their ill-wishers. Dynamic and ambitious, these people, as our own experience shows, are usually quite open to new ideas, opportunities, and contacts.

There's another feature common to both types that may be useful for you. Both "visionaries" and "rising stars" are very mobile and always seek opportunities for business development and advancing their own careers. Having competitors and enemies within the enterprise and often communicating with headhunters, they prefer to lead any interaction with outsiders away from their own offices. They're more likely than others to participate in conferences and educational business programs where you can get the opportunity to cross paths with them and establish contact in a calmer setting.

One example of the most successful investments in recent years is Yahoo's decision to invest in the young Chinese e-commerce platform Alibaba. To a significant degree, this success became possible thanks to the ability of Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang to identify "rising stars." Jerry Yang himself was born in Taiwan but at the age of ten immigrated to the United States with his family. Having received an education at Stanford University, he founded an internet business that later under the name Yahoo became one of the most successful internet portals.

Three years after founding his business, Jerry made his first trip to mainland China. Upon arrival, he was met by Jack Ma, at that time a junior employee of the Chinese Ministry of Economics. They became close during one of the mountain hikes where they enthusiastically discussed the potential possibilities of the internet. Inspired, Jack Ma founded Alibaba, hoping to bring Chinese companies to the world stage through the internet.

In 2005, Jerry and Jack met again at a summit of leaders from China and Silicon Valley. Alibaba had begun gaining momentum in China but still remained an outsider in the world market. Perceptive Jerry, correctly assessing Jack Ma's potential, during a short walk on the beach negotiated investments in the then-unprofitable Alibaba. This deal subsequently proved fateful. Yahoo's investment in Alibaba paid off handsomely (40 times over!), which only emphasizes Jerry Yang's amazing mastery in identifying talented partners.

## Four Problems in Working with Organizations

Working with organizations, you'll most likely encounter four typical problems. The first is managing your priorities and time. If you don't focus with laser precision on what's most important, you'll be drawn into the company's internal squabbles or get stuck in relationships with courteous and pleasant but at the same time powerless people, ultimately not achieving desired results. You'll have to make difficult decisions about how much time and with whom you spend it and which relationships need to be "frozen." And here your contact network map of the given organization will again help you stay on track.

The second difficulty arises when you suddenly lose important supporters within the company. People don't remain forever in the same positions. They relocate, they have conflicts with others, they're fired... And they won't warn you about this. As a result, you lose access, lose sources of information. Your time and efforts are wasted. That's why you can never rely on one single person. Developing an entire network of supporters must become your constant concern.

One of us lost access to a large organization in France when its first vice president—an active supporter and good friend—came into conflict with a major shareholder of the company who, after many years as a passive investor, decided to take management into their own hands. We worked with this organization for many years, but despite the long history of relationships, all doors for us closed overnight. Could we have foreseen such an unexpected turn of events? As strategists in networking, probably could have. And if we'd followed the simple rule not to close around one person, we wouldn't have encountered such a problem.

The third difficulty consists in overcoming dependence and jealousy. People, especially those who brought you in and helped in the early stages, want to control your advancement within the company: to know whom you're meeting with, what new things you're learning. When you need to move further, expanding your influence and building other relationships at higher levels, your past helpers may begin to envy you, and if you don't find the right approach to them, they'll throw sticks in your wheels. Managing such relationships is a delicate matter requiring great tact and, unfortunately, time. The least you can do to minimize the above-mentioned envy is to pave your path in the enterprise so that your initial "guides" themselves bring you to new contacts.

In the unfortunate case described above with the first vice president, when all "eggs," as they say, were placed in one basket, not one but two whole mistakes were made. Why didn't other top managers in the organization come to help, despite the fact that they were quite satisfied with the joint work? Because they envied the consultant's "exclusive" relationships with their former boss. Was enough work done to strengthen relationships with not one but several managers? Clearly not enough...

The fourth problem arises if you find yourself drawn into a power struggle in the organization in which or with which you work. Attracting outside experts—consultants, lawyers, supplier representatives—as tools for achieving personal goals is common practice among managers fighting for power. Such "mercenaries," or rather...

rather, "cannon fodder," are expected not to be needed after the task is solved. There are even cases when warring parties hire a "temporary" boss to implement a policy that might damage their own reputation. Thus Carlos Ghosn, a Frenchman of Lebanese-Brazilian origin who became famous as the executive director of the Renault concern, was hired by the owners of Japanese Nissan to lead a painful restructuring of the company that no Japanese would undertake. And as soon as the job was done, the real "bosses" of Japanese business standing behind Nissan—one of the symbols of Japanese industry—shamelessly got rid of him. Hence an important lesson: never take anyone's side in internal power battles in an organization, even if you think you're on the winning side. It may seem you've won, but still it's possible you'll need cooperation from many of those who lost now and who, undoubtedly, can later greatly darken your life. This strategic mistake almost cost Carlos Ghosn many years in a Japanese prison, if not for a daring escape to his homeland, Lebanon.

## Influence in Network and Virtual Organizations

But what to do if an organization has no center of power? What if there's no structure there at all? Increasingly we observe organizations with very low formal hierarchy—from high-tech startups to virtual volunteer groups. They feel and behave like distributed networks. However, even there not all people are equal. Whom should you orient toward in developing relationships? How can you identify power centers in non-hierarchical organizations? How can you increase your influence there? Let's try to answer these questions.

In an ideal hierarchical organization, such as, for example, the military, your power is a function of "vertical height" in the organizational structure. All power is delegated from above. To increase your "weight," you have only one way—climb the organizational ladder.

But what to do if the organization isn't just networked but entirely virtual, for example an internet community—as in IT or creative industries? How to build your influence there? To describe the distribution of forces in networks, let's use a metaphor. When on a clear night you look at the sky, you primarily notice either stars familiar to you, or stars that look larger because they're closer to Earth, or those distinguished by extraordinary brightness, or so-called "shooting" stars that suddenly cross the sky, or, finally, large constellations.

The same principles operate in the virtual world. Just the same, to have influence and consequently certain power in a personal network, you must be either well-known, or be in someone's closest circle of communication, or prove yourself a remarkable, bright personality, or be engaged in something unusual, or be part of a well-recognized, respected group. If you want to become more noticeable, more important in the network, you need to think about how to get into one of the described categories.

To be visible, known, you need to become a kind of "driver" of interactions, discussions, create traffic around yourself—become the owner of a node in the communication platform. You need to become a virtual "connector."

If you want to get closer to specific people, you need to offer them some value. You can find and share information that's of interest to them, take part in their discussions, in solving their problems. This will give you a reason to contact them directly.

But is it easy to become a "bright star"? If you're not confident in the value of your own ideas, you can become a skillful aggregator of others'. Become the "king of content," a person to whom one can turn for useful information. Create a kind of knowledge exchange platform. People who don't have time for detailed, lengthy searches will go straight to you. It will be even better if you can create a reputation as a source of "cool material." This is precisely the role bloggers play, whose audience often reaches millions of subscribers.

Finally, a bit about recognizable "constellations." As in real life, try to communicate with recognizable, interesting people. By participating in their chats and commenting on their posts, you'll become associated with "your own," attract attention to yourself, and achieve recognition in the online communities that interest you. In short, get your status "by association."

# Chapter 7. Up the Social Ladder

For a spy, creating a network of contacts isn't the ultimate goal—it's only a necessary base and tool for achieving a more important task. A spy must constantly raise their social status and climb the social ladder. If they don't do this, their value will remain quite limited. Those who have access to secrets and are involved in important decisions are at the top of society, whether politicians, government officials, or leading scientists. If you're not interesting to them, if you don't belong to the same social strata, if they can't benefit from your knowledge and contacts, if your personality doesn't excite them, they'll have no desire to deal with you.

---

## Social Capital

Constant ascent up the social ladder has another name—accumulation of personal social capital. Without delving into concepts of social disciplines, social capital is the goodwill, recognition, and help you receive from people you know in your surrounding community. It's precisely the result of accumulated positive interaction with surrounding people that gives you the right to privileges of inclusion in the community with all its possible advantages—material and intangible. Put simply, social capital is "who you know" from the old saying "It's not what you know, it's who you know."

Networking creates social capital. The magnitude of social capital, or reputation, is a function of your personal and professional value multiplied by success in networking. Your place in society is, in essence, your accumulated social capital. Speaking in business language, your social status is personal "capital" in which "profit" is that social capital you accumulate each year. Your networking results are your "income." The better your personal contact network, the better and stronger your position in corresponding circles.

The value of strategy in networking becomes most obvious if you consider that your efficiency—the ratio of results of strengthening your status to efforts expended—depends on how well you've set priorities.

For illustration, let's quote American career coach Bonnie Marcus from Forbes magazine: "A strong personal network is like money in the bank. Your network can help you become visible, connect with influential people, and open doors to new opportunities. Building and developing a network is one of the most powerful things you can do to support your own career growth. Nevertheless, often our networking efforts are reduced merely to empty small talk, are unsystematic, and, as a consequence, ineffective. You make friends and connections, but not always are these people able to help in your further career or, most importantly, put in a good word for you at the right moment." The quote may seem long, but it shows how important good strategy is in networking...

## How to Turn Contacts into Social Capital

Methods for building social capital and social status can also be divided into micro- and macro-. As discussed earlier, the method with the prefix micro- is aimed at improving influence on people around you, and macro- at your position in society as a whole. According to the micro-methodology, there are three proven ways to increase your social capital by relying on your network of contacts. We've already mentioned some of them earlier, but here they're worth repeating.

First, get closer to communication centers, to "connectors." Whether it's about a company, local community, or any organization, try to become a kind of "exchange manager," well, or universal intermediary—this way you'll find yourself at the main node of all relationships. The more central and noticeable your position becomes—the better. Being proactive and being a volunteer are keys to success. On one hand, being at the center of communications will help you "build" necessary bridges, expanding your network's reach. On the other hand, such a position will provide opportunities to do many good deeds: share information, show care and participation, offer help, redirect resources. The next step is to become indispensable, that is, a person who knows everyone and helps everyone. The game is worth the candle. The respect, gratitude, access to information, and new opportunities acquired in the process will more than cover all your "operating costs."

Surprisingly, "connector" positions in many groups and organizations are practically vacant. Maybe this is because most people are lazy or afraid to take initiative and responsibility for communication flows. True, such work really does take much time and effort. When one of us volunteered to revive the overseas alumni network of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, they immediately understood that no one had dealt with this before, at least there were no official records of it at the institution. If few were attracted to the "connector" position in such a famous organization, what can be said about other groups and communities?

Second, try to create your "advisory board," staff it with people who are respected and who inspire universal admiration. This doesn't have to be a formal group, and your advisors don't have to know each other personally. It's important that these people be capable of playing a positive role in your personal growth or helping your career by giving advice and connections.

The term "advisory board" sounds too "corporate," however the practice of surrounding yourself with experienced, knowledgeable people is universal. Several years ago, after the first lecture in a lecture series that one of the authors of this book gives at MGIMO in Moscow, a student approached him and offered to become his assistant for the course. During the semester, several lengthy conversations took place with her in which questions far beyond the lectures were discussed, and the book's author shared his experience and essentially acted as a coach. At the end of the course, the author agreed to become the student's advisor for her thesis, and later gave her a good recommendation when she was getting a job. Most remarkably, the girl, as it turned out later, offered her help to professors on almost every course of which she was an attendee. Imagine how much advice, help, and good connections she received over her years of study! We're confident she'll become a skillful diplomat and excellent networker.

It's very important to have among your advisors and mentors "rising stars" who can pull you along when they, in turn, raise their status. For a spy, searching for "rising stars" is one of the most important tasks. Such proactive work pays off handsomely. It's enough to refer to the example of Richard Moore, head of the British Secret Service. After joining MI-6, Moore spent several years in Turkey in the early 1990s. There he studied Turkish and was an active fan of the local football club Beşiktaş, which translated from social terminology to professional means he was engaged in recruiting members of Istanbul's elite. At that time, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was just beginning his political career in Istanbul. The efforts invested bore fruit many years later when Richard Moore became the United Kingdom's ambassador to Turkey and one of Erdoğan's most valuable supporters and influential friends. Surely not without the help of mutual acquaintances acquired thirty years ago!

Third, it's necessary to get closer to real leaders—key figures in the company or community. Here your task is simple—learn from them, comprehending something new and useful for yourself. After all, to occupy their current position, such people undertook something, accomplished something—and, judging by the results, these were the right actions. Most likely, they understand the essence of the real world and their own organizations better than others—and better than you. In addition, they have access to certain resources. Getting closer to influential people, you get the opportunity to learn something from them, imitate their approaches and behavior. Ideally, you should strive to make them your mentors—in hope that someday you'll inherit their connections and status.

The famous Soviet spy Iosif Grigulevich (1913-1988) under the name Teodoro B. Castro passed himself off as the illegitimate son of a wealthy Costa Rican coffee producer. In Rome he founded an import-export company and established extensive personal contacts with local businessmen—especially those close to the Catholic Church. Over time, he managed to become a close friend and business partner of the former president of Costa Rica. As a result, in 1951 "Teodoro B. Castro" was appointed ambassador of Costa Rica to Italy and the Vatican, which made him a key insider at the top of the Catholic Church and Italian political circles.

## Riding "Social Elevators"

When it comes to your position in society as a whole, raising your social status is akin to riding social elevators. You need to understand which elevators go up and find a way to jump into them.

Thinking about your status in strategic perspective, we can say that the choices we periodically have to make in life can bring us to different career trajectories—some higher, others lower. Some life paths look preferable from the very beginning—birth into a family of wealthy and influential parents clearly facilitates life and career just as getting maximum scores on the EGE (Unified State Exam) or American SAT test (Scholastic Assessment Test) gives you more chances to enter Moscow State University or Stanford. However, even if we can't control our starting point, the further trajectory of our life depends on choices we make. These trajectories don't necessarily lead you upward. Many smart children of famous parents ultimately become worthless people, alcoholics, or drug addicts. Good education, correct choice of profession, business industry and workplace, successful friends, and a supportive spouse can radically change your life trajectory. At any moment in life, you can find yourself at an "elevator"—with short-term and long-term opportunities—and this "elevator" will help bring your life to a higher level. You simply need to look for these elevators and be ready to jump into them. Since almost all chances for further advancement depend on whether you know the right people, your life strategy and networking strategy must work as one whole. Your task is to create an "elevator of opportunities" for yourself as a professional spy would do.

---

## Education—Your "Ticket" Upward

The most obvious, simple, and accessible social elevator is education. Practically any educational program will raise your competencies and status. The best of them can become reliable conductors to elite circles. Our intelligence career included training in four university programs; the outcome of the last was a master's degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in the prestigious USA. This was a difficult climb to the "peaks" if you take into account that we began our path in an unfamiliar country without even a high school diploma. At night we had to study, and during the day—work.

However, the most significant gain from education isn't the new knowledge you receive but the new people you meet. Educational space—universities, short-term business programs, professional courses—is the most open and egalitarian environment in society. This allows people from different strata to communicate with each other without the social barriers that one way or another are present in everyday life. If you want to create connections beyond your daily sphere of communication, you won't find a better place.

In addition, people come to study because either they're seeking new knowledge and opportunities or are dissatisfied with themselves and their current work. This means they're searching for themselves and are open to everything new—including new friends. If you want to fill your network with interesting and successful people, educational institutions have no equal in this sense.

## Join Status Groups

What else can bring you to a better trajectory and raise status? Of course, a place in status groups. Joining private clubs, attending exclusive events—these are quite obvious but often expensive choices. Therefore, we suggest considering other options: professional societies, non-profit organizations, alumni associations, cigar and wine clubs, sports teams, political parties, as well as groups advocating various issues of public importance. Study options for participation in volunteer work and think tank presentations, helping sponsor public events, amateur theaters, and exhibitions.

There's a wonderful example of a person who made a name and career for himself as an organizer of status events. His name is Klaus Schwab. Being a 33-year-old professor at a Swiss university, he created a discussion platform now known as the World Economic Forum. Schwab can be considered an unsurpassed networker. He skillfully used his organization to establish connections with presidents and kings around the world. But his most remarkable achievement is that he created a networking machine that did this work for him! As they say, we take our hat off to such talent!

While you're building your career and climbing the corporate ladder, you naturally spend most time with people inside or around your business and profession. However, if you want to establish yourself in the upper strata of society, you'll need to make a special emphasis on expanding your network and creating connections outside your professional sphere.

There are periods of rapid career growth, but never say never to stagnation and even falls. Your status in professional circles is strongly tied to the status of your workplace. If you're unlucky, it may happen that your colleagues lose interest in you. The same will happen when you retire. However, relationships that arose in other spheres of life will most likely persist. After all, they're based not so much on business and professional interests as on all sorts of other interests.

As an additional bonus, a wide spectrum of connections in different spheres will allow you to become a "connector" for your friends and establish exchange of "relationship currency." And, most importantly, you'll have what money can't buy—an interesting and diverse life!

---

## Enter the Public Space

Another way to raise your social status is to become a publicly known person. To occupy a prominent place in society, you don't have to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature or become a senator. Even average bloggers usually have up to several hundred thousand subscribers. If you have interesting content, then to convey it to the rest of the world, you don't need to own media platforms like CNN, RT, or Al Jazeera. Practically any acquired fame gives you levers of influence in the public space and raises your status. Here, again, content plays a key role! So, if there's an opportunity, write, make a film, or release interesting material. If you don't feel you're capable of creating good content independently, become a content aggregator, manager of a content platform under your own name. The spectrum of content is truly limitless—from cooking lessons to international politics.

Any attempts to undertake something interesting or unusual will inevitably attract other people to you, regardless of whether you're crossing a continent by bicycle or writing a book about how to grow tomatoes. You'll get a double effect. First, you'll find yourself in a new...

*[Continued from Chunk 12]*

community of bicycle enthusiasts or tomato producers—with new large international networks for communication.

Second, you'll find yourself at the center of attention. People will be drawn to you by natural curiosity. You've probably heard about the attraction that the mysterious world of "bohemia" creates for influential politicians and businessmen. The most famous example of such attraction is the story of Mata Hari, a Dutch exotic dancer in Paris during World War I. She was accused of using her connections with high-ranking French officials for espionage in favor of the Germans. While Mata Hari's effectiveness as a spy was greatly exaggerated, the attraction of rich and influential people to the young artist was quite real.

To emphasize the advantage of creative personalities in networking, we'd like to cite as an example the Soviet illegal intelligence officer and talented architect Yuri Shevchenko. During the Cold War, working in Europe under the legend of an artist, he achieved remarkable results, receiving for his many years of work the highest state award—the title of Hero of Russia. During a certain period, he alone supplied up to a third of all NATO secret documents that Soviet intelligence possessed.

## Help Solve Important Problems

By responding to a recognized public need as an organizer or participant in projects important to the city or company, you gain recognition and respect. It's unlikely anyone would have noticed Swedish activist—schoolgirl Greta Thunberg—if people weren't concerned about the state of the environment.

In every city and every organization there are always problems causing disputes and attracting public interest. Issues of politics, environment, education, security, or city life always require someone to help solve them.

Mass media "feed" on these problems. Show activity, participate in public discussions—and you'll instantly become a valuable guest for reporters and interviewers whose work consists of constantly searching for content to fill the 24-hour news cycle every day. And if you move from words to action—say, organize cleaning of the local river—you can generally become a media hero.

Just be careful that the issue you take on doesn't cause negative emotions, isn't petty and situational, and doesn't create in others a feeling that you're promoting exclusively your personal interests. Many bloggers with millions of subscribers have earned quite a bit of money promoting their "brand" and all sorts of products. However, they often evoke more envy than admiration from subscribers. Your image in the media space should help create friends and allies, not just envious viewers.

If it seems you can't do this alone, find people or organizations dealing with issues that concern you and offer them help. We're confident—your investments of time and energy will soon give you the right to become one of their leaders.

## "A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss!"

One of the unusual ways to raise your status that we discovered for ourselves as spies is to constantly be "in motion." Both in the sense of travel and in the sense of making constant changes in your own life.

The benefits of travel are quite obvious. Flights, tourist trips, cruises, hotels in remote places—all this is amazing opportunities for meeting interesting people who also want new sensations. The personalities you meet on such trips are on average more dynamic, more communicative, and more successful in life. Exactly this type of people is needed as friends. If you work diligently on acquiring contacts during trips and their subsequent development, many of them may well become the next step in your career. It's not for nothing they say that "travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer." In terms of new friends and new opportunities—you certainly can't argue! During our work, we used, for example, vacations for travel to wine-producing regions—from France to California, South Africa, and Argentina, to meet with people whose profile was of interest to us. And an additional bonus was good wine!

Being in motion, in the sense of readiness to change location or take risks, is a necessary condition for raising your own status. Long stays in one place create a safe, comfortable emotional environment that gradually binds, entangles, constrains you, "freezing" your status in the company or society. After some time, no one around expects anything new and exciting from you anymore, no one shows their former interest in you. In people's consciousness, the opinion has formed that you are what you are, that you've already reached your "ceiling." As soon as "public opinion" about you is formed, you're inevitably stuck in this niche. That's precisely why successful managers try not to stay in one place for long: they want to move along an "ascending" trajectory.

As spies, we successfully used the principle of so-called "country-to-country jumps." Each country's elites have their own hierarchy—unspoken rules for determining status. While in the perception of who you are relative to others in elite circles, money plays a significant role, family connections and place in the media space are also important. As soon as your acquaintances learn about your origin, family and education, places where you worked, etc., they'll immediately mentally place you at a certain level and treat you accordingly. Violating the established order and pretending you occupy a higher social position is practically impossible. People won't assign you higher status until you achieve something significant to deserve it.

Nevertheless, a person who arrived from abroad, from another culture, and sometimes simply from another city, can "game the system." Their real social status, if it's not obvious from appearance and behavior, is difficult for their new environment to "decipher." The natural curiosity of the local public will give the stranger a temporary advantage. They'll be assigned higher status by default, at least until their real affairs show otherwise.

The famous Israeli spy Eli Cohen (1924-1965) was sent in 1960 by Mossad to perform a special assignment under the guise of a successful Syrian businessman. His goal was to collect intelligence among high-ranking Syrian politicians and military officials. Under the name Kamel Amin Thaabet, he went to Argentina and settled in the Syrian emigrant community. Living in Buenos Aires, he became close to a person who subsequently became president of Syria. Eventually Cohen moved to Damascus, where he was able to integrate into the upper layers of Syrian society. His "project" for creating a network of contacts consisted of holding parties at his home for high-ranking representatives of the Syrian political and business world. Eli Cohen never could have become admitted to the very closed circles of the Syrian elite if he hadn't come from a distant country.

# Chapter 8. Launching Operation "Network"

The time has come for decisive and active actions! Now you know what needs to be done to build your "ecosystem" of contacts and how to do it. However, as we warned at the very beginning, in networking it's more important not to know but to do. It will be simultaneously difficult and interesting for you. The goal of this chapter is to give you several more practical tips. They'll help you confidently hold to the planned course. Others will once again warn you against possible mistakes.

## Find Yourself a Coach

Everyone knows how difficult it sometimes is to force yourself to face daily problems and disappointments. That's precisely why we turn to fitness trainers, dietitians, and family counselors. The same applies to networking. Your plans may be simply ideal in their conception, but when it comes time to meet with someone after a long workday, you feel too tired to force yourself to execute them. And the people you meet, you don't interest much yet. Therefore, it may turn out that you feel disappointed and demotivated.

That's why at such moments there should be a person nearby to whom you can turn for help. You need a coach capable of listening to your problems, supporting and suggesting a solution. But what's even more important, you need someone who can ask difficult questions and make you think. Your coach should play the role of a kind of mirror in which you'll see yourself as you are. This is someone with whom you can discuss and think through your plans and actions. You can't improve and become better if you don't have an honest and objective view of yourself from the outside. Your coach can emphasize your shortcomings but at the same time motivate you for further actions. Try to find among your friends someone who can give you an honest and unbiased assessment. Not all close friends are capable of this. And since every person has their own judgments and "blind spots," having two such coaches is even better. Your long-term goal: surround yourself with trusted people who can help you progress not only as a networker but as a professional and simply as a person. And don't forget about your personal "advisory board"!

## Choose a Role Model

As social beings, we learn to behave correctly by imitating others. There's nothing bad or humiliating in the desire to follow someone else's example in striving to repeat and surpass someone else's achievements. Knowing we might be observed, with every step recorded and analyzed, we learned to imitate behavioral patterns characteristic of different peoples and cultures. Imagine you're crossing several borders with different passports. If you don't pay attention to how you behave and what you say, any careless gesture can give you away as quickly as an incorrect answer to a border guard. A good example is the catastrophic mistake of Michael Fassbender's character in Quentin Tarantino's film "Inglourious Basterds." He "blew his cover" when, posing as a German officer, he counted on his fingers in a way uncharacteristic for this nation...

Hence the advice: find a person you admire as a networker and leader, and analyze what qualities make them attractive to those around them. Observe how they interact with other people and try to imitate. And even better—try to connect with this person, ask for advice, and become friends with them.

## Learn to Motivate Yourself

A key component of your networking is motivation. As spies, we were in a privileged position—we were driven by a deep understanding of the importance of our work, our patriotic convictions, and our ambitions. We had no shortage of motivation. Facing difficulties and fatigue, we understood that we couldn't turn from the path and admit our inadequacy as officers and professionals. In ordinary life, everyone can find various excuses and pretexts. Many are accustomed to putting everything off "for later." After all, you can always find a reason to give yourself a break. We're not some kind of superhumans...

You should view efforts spent on networking not as expenses but as investments. Just as you invest your money, here you invest your time in a better future, in new opportunities that your contact network will later bring. In investments there's a law of accumulated interest: the more you reinvest, the larger the monetary base, the faster the sum accumulates in your account. The earlier you start investing, the more your savings will grow by retirement. The same law applies to networking: the earlier you start, the larger your network will be, the faster it will grow, and the larger it will ultimately become. Movement generates movement. People in the network themselves will bring you to new contacts without any special efforts on your part. Each new person multiplies your future opportunities, each new increment of social capital raises your status.

## Don't Be Afraid of Rejection

Another important skill in communication: try to curb your fear of being rejected. Prepare to calmly take blows. Someone definitely won't like you, and some may even unambiguously show you the door. For us, as spies, over the course of our career such cases accumulated more than enough. Making so-called "cold calls" is always unpleasant, but experience overcoming fear and awkwardness when communicating with completely unfamiliar people can't be replaced by anything, it's simply priceless. Remember the energetic young guys with badges and boxes who for a while went door to door, called apartments, and offered irons, kettles, and God knows what else? Many refused to communicate with them, but some agreed to buy the offered goods from them. Experienced people will confirm that precisely such sales experience gives a person excellent skills, toughens them. So don't be frightened: unpleasant work connected with communicating with various categories of the population will also help you overcome fear of public speaking.

On the very first day at business school, we were given a group exercise that seemed partly amusing and partly mocking. We had to go to a busy intersection and sell drinking water in plastic cups to pedestrians. In the center of a big city, we looked idiotically ridiculous then. But a child selling homemade lemonade in the same plastic cups wouldn't cause any rejection from the public.

The whole point is that children don't have an innate fear of embarrassment—they simply approach and ask about what they need. Fear of being rejected is imposed on us by society and various codes about what's "right" and what's not. Different cultures have their so-called "acceptable forms of behavior." For example, talking to a stranger on the street may look quite normal in the United States or Italy but will be disapproved of in Finland, Japan, or Russia. Moreover, if people reject your offer, you're unlikely to see them again—so what's the difference! Over time, when you have thousands of contacts and hundreds of rejections behind you, you'll acquire thick "elephant skin" and with it a philosophical attitude toward life.

## "Camouflage" Your Networking Among Other Affairs

But where to find time for everything? There's no "magic" recipe on this account. You can't allocate time for life and separately—for communication. It won't work that way. Networking will have to be made an organic part of your life. From our personal experience, learning networking is like studying a foreign language or playing the violin: to develop the skill, you must do this every day—sometimes just a few minutes, but daily.

Whatever you do, wherever you go—think about whom you can talk to, whom you can meet. And conversely: plan your activity—education, sports, walks, vacations—constantly thinking about networking goals. Take the schedule of events and affairs you're planning for the next month and write in networking work day by day: this way you'll better distribute your efforts and time. If you've divided people into priority groups, use free time—for example, when waiting for a doctor's appointment or a flight at the airport—to call by phone or write by email, put likes and comments. Compile an annual list of birthdays and, according to set priorities, plan visits, dinners, and buy gifts so that all this fits into other affairs and trips. Review the schedule of interesting events and conferences and optimize it for your networking strategy. Invite new acquaintances to train or travel together, simultaneously developing relationships. Hold parties for several friends at once and invite new acquaintances whose connections you want to strengthen. The more proactively you behave, the better you plan and organize—the more effectively you'll learn to use your own time.

## Keep a Diary

For a spy, keeping a diary would probably be the most foolish idea that could come to mind: for counterintelligence this would be a priceless treasure trove of information completely exposing all secret work.

However, a diary performs a most important function, especially necessary at initial stages of any new complex work—it excellently organizes thoughts, performing the role of a virtual interlocutor. In addition, leaving behind a chain of memory about events and thoughts, it, in the case of networking, allows you to return to meetings and conversations that happened earlier, "register" facts and emotions, and look at what happened from the height of accumulated experience.

From a purely practical point of view, your diary will become a repository of information about your contacts, and together with the calendar-planner that's part of every yearbook, it will help you, as we just discussed, better fit networking into the flow of your daily affairs. And your regular entries will be invaluable material for analyzing your forward movement!

## Periodic Analysis of Your Network

**Stage 1**

Looking at the picture of your contact network, ask yourself—how much does your network correspond to the challenges you face? What are your life goals for the next year or two? Where do you see yourself? To what degree do people in your network correspond to the goals you've set? Can they help you achieve what you're planning? With whom from your contacts do you spend most of your time? Is this the most effective use of your time? Do you have problems in relationships with anyone in your network? Mark the most important people and assess how contacts with them are developing. Mark relationships you want to fix.

**Stage 2**

Take a pen of another color, say red, and mark on your network picture those changes you'd like to implement. Who can help you and how to meet them? Where are the people from whom you'd like to learn? Can any of your current contacts introduce you to them? Mark those who could become mentors for you. Write down whom you want to meet. Look at whether any of your existing contacts can introduce you to them. Then take another sheet of paper and write an action plan for the next month.

**Stage 3**

At least once a month, set aside a sufficiently quiet hour in the evening to review your personal contact network. Assess how successfully you implemented your plan and what could be improved. Mark new acquaintances on the map. Analyze changes in relationships over the past month. Repeat stages 1 and 2. This should become a habit for you, become necessary routine. In six months you'll see yourself what amazing results you'll achieve in networking!

## Respect Personal Space and Others' Time

Throughout most of the book, we've introduced you to networking by teaching skills and strategies for achieving success. However, like any honest teacher, it's important for us to transmit not only knowledge but also wisdom accumulated from our own mistakes. Thus, our conversation won't be finished until we pay attention to the ethics of networking and problems we ourselves have encountered.

Networking is, first of all, social activity. In addition to the general desire to be a good person, you must respect others and take into account what influence your actions have on other people and the surrounding world.

Everyone has encountered people in life who torment others and accept no refusals. Don't become one of them. For a professional, such behavior is a sure path to failure. As we've already said, in relationships with other people, spies must be "gardeners," not "hunters." If you want relationships to flourish, you must respect others' personal space and private life. Encroaching on other people's private lives or disrespecting boundaries they themselves establish is one of the fastest ways to fundamentally destroy emerging relationships. Worse, reviews of your aggressive tactics will spoil future relationships with other people. Moreover, this will happen in absentia, without your knowledge.

In addition, you must remember the limited attention people can spend on you. Everyone has something happening in their lives, and in most cases you won't be in first place for others. Don't demand too much from your friends and acquaintances. In addition to the limited time they can devote to you, people also have emotional and empathetic limitations. It's not for nothing they say that "sharing a problem is half solving it" (well, or more in Russian: "one head is good, but two are better"). However, don't expect other people to bend over backwards for you. There's a fine line between positive support and emotional dependence. Respect the fact that, however much most people want to help you, each of them has their own life and limited capabilities for caring about others.

Friendship can be built, but it can't be imposed. What's most obvious in romantic relationships is quite applicable to all interpersonal connections as well. Having seen a clear signal that a person doesn't wish to deepen relationships with you, you must accept everything as it is and stop any attempts to change this. As we've already said, you must always have a virtual GoPro camera with you. If these people eventually change their minds, they'll return to you themselves. As a good networker, you must have a plan "B" in reserve so that no, even the most painful, rejection becomes an insurmountable obstacle in achieving your life goals.

We'd like to remind you about the risks that close relationships entail. It's no secret that often the most terrible and bloody showdowns happen within families and between the closest friends. The reason here is quite simple: when we trust someone, we thereby give them the opportunity to hurt us where we're most vulnerable. You must always be attentive to your actions toward the closest people. As spies, we put our lives on the line by trusting our Service, colleagues, and compatriots. The same tension exists, albeit at a less fatal level, between all close relationships, whether in business or personal life. You must do everything possible to maintain others' trust and never use information shared with you "in secret" to hurt or threaten those around you.

And the last thing we'd like to mention is the importance of observing boundaries. Networking isn't a game, and people aren't tools. We can't give you a complete and exhaustive list of what's ethical and what's not. You must figure this out yourself and establish your own boundaries. Most importantly—you must be able to recognize these boundaries before you reach them. If you don't do this, you'll find yourself on a slippery slope where you'll have to justify every action that can become increasingly unethical and self-destructive.

## Don't Try to Manipulate People

As you master networking techniques to perfection and gain experience in productive communication with different people, you may be tempted to use your abilities to make others do something useful for you against their own will. Even if you're pursuing the most noble and righteous goals, on this path there's always a probability of falling into an ethical trap, especially when using unacceptable means to achieve them. Many highly effective methods of managing interpersonal relationships may turn out to be not entirely ethical. Such means are often resorted to by swindlers, aggressive partners, and criminals. Suppress in yourself the desire to apply such methods if it suddenly appears. In addition to being unethical, these methods will most likely harm you greatly in the long run. After all, your task is to strategically build healthy, productive relationships, not twist others' arms through emotional pressure or coercion.

In practice, such methods most often are based on false or misleading information in which an ordinary person won't find anything suspicious. In the sphere of information warfare, such methods are called "social engineering." Leaders of religious sects, pimps, and swindlers use various psychological techniques to control their victims. Without going into details of forbidden methods, we'll point out one characteristic feature: they're based on a stronger emotional reaction to help than to pain, even if both come from the same person.

An aggressive partner will first cause harm and agonizing experiences to their victims, then turn everything around and offer emotional support. Despite the fact that such emotional "swings" are a source of troubles and misfortunes, they turn out to be a highly effective means of creating emotional dependence and evoke in victims a desire to prove they're worthy of the attacker. Under no circumstances should you apply such methods or anything similar to get close to people, much less control them. Instead of using other people's weaknesses, you should focus on their strengths and build close relationships on the positive. Fear may seem like an effective tool, but it's a short-lived means and, in essence, a double-edged sword. In intelligence, fear is the very last resort that can be used only once.

## Learn to Forget and Forgive

It's important to achieve your goals. But not at any cost. You build your network to improve the quality of your life, not to prove something to someone. Including not to endlessly expand your network or chase after some landmark contact. As professionals, we've had to think more than once about the meaning of networking. At the beginning of our career, an official came into our field of vision from whose opportunities and connections we, as intelligence officers, literally "salivated." We were at a distance of "one handshake" from this person and, as the rules required, prepared for our leadership at "Headquarters" a detailed plan for approaching the official. The answer from "Headquarters" literally shocked us. "Leave him alone," the cipher read, "you're not yet capable of working with such a connection." Upset and disappointed, we tried to argue, but to no avail. A year or two later, during a secret meeting with one of our operative supervisors, we again raised the question about the official. "Well look, guys," we heard in response, "we track a huge number of contacts of your colleagues around the world. We see what works and what doesn't. We keep statistics on contacts, including yours. Even if you managed to establish this contact, you wouldn't be able to maintain it. You'd have nothing to offer a person of such high level. Your contact would stall, and its loss would put an end to the possibility of reaching this person again in the future when you're ready for it." In other words—don't bite off more than you can chew...

The rich practical experience of intelligence service leaders once again emphasizes the thesis we're developing in this book: networking and social status go hand in hand, they're two sides of the same coin. Accumulating an increasing number of connections that add nothing to your social position and don't solve your problems makes no sense. In the end, everything is decided by the quality of your relationships. And to ensure the effectiveness expected of you by your friends and colleagues, you'll have to make efforts to become increasingly informed, resourceful, and attractive.

In a word, the better you become, the better your network becomes. As your value to others grows and new opportunities open before you, an increasingly high level of connections becomes available to you.

Networking, like politics, is "the art of the possible." This is about what we're really capable of doing. Not everything depends on us. Some relationships will inevitably turn out problematic. Some of those you consider friends will suddenly start plotting intrigues and spreading gossip about you. Someone will borrow from you and then stop answering your calls. Unfortunately, humanity is still far from ideal. All we can do is fulfill our own promises in hope that others will do the same. In relationships between people, there will always remain something of a lottery—sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. However—attention! If the same problems in relationships arise again and again, this is a reason to turn your gaze to yourself: maybe you yourself missed something...

And sometimes it's worth simply turning the page and moving forward. Preserving the health of your ecosystem of connections is much more important than trying at any cost to preserve some of them, even the most prestigious. There are no irreplaceable people. Don't take offenses too close to heart. Don't hold onto problematic relationships. Never try to take revenge. Don't waste your time and energy in vain—move forward. In strategic networking, good mood and motivation are your main assets. After all, you have more important things to do!

# Conclusion. Networking as Self-Improvement

Perhaps the main thing our intelligence work taught us is to be proactive. We had no other choice but to ourselves manage everything that happens around us, especially our connections. Our path to the goal implied that every movement of ours, every contact had to have meaning and a plan. As operative workers, we automatically became designers and builders of our human environment. Time after time, step by step, we surrounded ourselves with the people we needed. The goals of our work with people could be different, but in all cases we used a proven set of methods.

Just like spies, you can manage your own human "ecosystem." It's in your power to make the networking process purposeful and effective. For raising your social status, there's a set of understandable and proven rules. However, there's one important condition: you must be ready to make serious efforts.

People value the quality of things that surround them. Agree, it's not all the same to us where we live and what objects are in our homes. However, our human environment influences the quality of our lives incomparably more than ordinary things. Our successes and even our happiness depend on how much the people around us correspond to our character and our goals. But often we're ready to accept our environment as it spontaneously developed, not trying to get rid of the problems embedded in it. We allow people around us to determine our fate, forgetting about our own tools for influencing this environment.

But there's one exception! We're very attentive to choosing our life partners—our spouses. We dream of a person with certain appearance and character, we search for them, build relationships with them, love them, and care for them for many years. We won't agree to make a choice of spouse blindly, understanding how much they will influence our life. And even with all this attention, it happens that we make mistakes in choice.

And what about all the other people surrounding us? Distracted by daily trifles, we forget about our closest friends. We allow discontent and conflicts to spoil relationships and sometimes corrode us from within. We're lazy to make new acquaintances, missing excellent opportunities.

We wrote this book with the goal of convincing our readers that each of them can build their own human "ecosystem," organized according to their own standards, using methods of strategic networking. We urge our readers to abandon a passive, random, thoughtless attitude toward their contacts. Instead, we strongly advise everyone to invest time and efforts in a network consisting of people you value and respect.

Try applying the techniques of strategic networking described in this book. After all, there's nothing mystical or inexplicable in strengthening your social status—it's an understandable step-by-step process accessible not only to unique geniuses of networking like David Rockefeller, Klaus Schwab, or Richard Sorge. We ourselves have gone through this path several times and are confident it's within your power too.

As a proactive, strategic networker, you'll have the privilege of purposefully filling your environment with people you need and who are pleasant to you. You'll be able to choose with whom it's better for you to work to make your life more interesting or your business more successful. As you develop contacts and your "ecosystem" becomes ever more extensive, you'll have the freedom to "disconnect" from those who bring you only pain and problems. With a large network of contacts, you'll always have a choice of whom to communicate with or not communicate with. And you certainly will never have to be bored alone.

Despite the fact that networking requires persistence and patience, its result is always new discoveries. Acquaintances with new wonderful people whom you otherwise would never have met. Discoveries of diverse exciting sides of life that you would never have explored if you hadn't made new friends. Finally, discoveries of opportunities that would be unavailable if you yourself hadn't taken that difficult first step.

Of course, networking isn't an end in itself but only a means of achieving a goal. This is a mechanism of continuous improvement of your life and self-improvement. As you surround yourself with an increasing number of people who in many respects are better, more literate, more experienced, more skillful, richer than you, you simultaneously get the opportunity to learn and enrich yourself in all senses of this word. The better and more perfect the people surrounding you, the better you yourself become and the better your life becomes. In conclusion, allow us to paraphrase the medieval Persian philosopher and poet Omar Khayyam and remind you that your life will be such as your environment will be.
