*[Continued from Chunk 1]*

needed to solve some business problem.

Or, if you look at city traffic from above—say, from a drone camera—you can easily find detour routes along less congested streets and get home or to work much faster. Seeing which streets are empty is impossible without having the overall picture before your eyes. In exactly the same way, the ability to simultaneously see all existing connections around you will help you understand that the important person you're so eager to reach happens to have a close friend who attended the same school as your spouse. Thus, to chart the best path to a specific person, you need a MAP of all your contacts.

However, before you can devise the best way to bypass "traffic jams," you still need to determine your direction. Before discussing HOW to make networking more effective, we must clearly understand WHY we need it. For instance, Franklin D. Roosevelt dreamed from childhood of becoming President of the United States, and throughout his entire life, all his efforts to create a network of necessary connections were focused precisely on this goal. You too need to decide what goals you want to achieve and who the people are who can help you with this. Your first step is to clearly define your "goals."

As young Soviet intelligence officers who had just begun work in a new country, we, of course, knew WHY we needed a network of personal connections. But where to start? We were overwhelmed by the enormity of the task. Yes, we made many acquaintances, these new contacts required more and more of our time, attention, and care, but they didn't bring us any closer to anything interesting. Remember the famous fable "The Swan, the Pike, and the Crayfish"? We felt that our relationships were pulling us in completely different directions. It was frustrating. We had created a set of relationships, but could this be called an effective network that served our purpose? Only with great stretch...

What we really lacked was strategy. Strategy, by definition, is a path to a goal, a certain trajectory. As soon as you think about a trajectory, many other questions arise. If you want to move from point A to point B, where exactly is point A? Why do you want to reach point B? Are there alternative routes? Which one is better? And by what criteria?

So, to think strategically, you need a method. It provides clarity and directs your efforts. We knew how to find people and develop relationships, but we didn't think about how to assemble them into a network that would work for us and on our behalf. At the beginning of our journey, we were tacticians, not strategists.

Strategic networking is not simply building relationships with a specific person. It's achieving your life and career goals with the help of all the people who surround you. In a properly built network, each connection strengthens other connections. Together, they reinforce your position in society as a whole.

Looking back, we understand that our career as intelligence officers under deep cover represents an amazing experiment in networking. As young operatives, we started our networking from scratch. We arrived in the country of our first assignment with only one suitcase. We repeated such insertion from scratch three times in three countries. And then, after the notorious spy scandal in the United States and the exchange in 2010, a fourth time—already in Russia. Because at home, in our homeland, by that time we knew practically no one except our parents and a few more employees at the headquarters of Russian foreign intelligence with whom we worked. Since we left to work abroad, 25 years had passed. Even school and university friends wouldn't recognize us now.

Understanding how strategic networking works came with our own many years of trial and error. Four university degrees and thousands of the most diverse contacts behind us gave us the opportunity to look at our rich practice as if from the outside. Years of intense work helped us develop a conceptual approach to strategic networking. Remembering our first years in intelligence, we can say with confidence that, armed with the right strategy, we could have achieved in a year or two what we then spent a full five years on. We would like to share this power of strategic networking with you.

Before moving forward, let's answer some questions that people have asked us when we shared our networking experience. Not surprisingly, most questions concerned motivation and psychological barriers that hold people back from implementing specific plans.

The most common problem cited is the time expenditure necessary to create an effective network of contacts. With our eternal busyness and deficit of attention, which even our loved ones receive from us only in the interval between work and household chores, where can we find time for full-fledged networking?

Let's be clear: networking really does take a lot of time. Building connections can sometimes be very emotionally draining. But as soon as you decide that your future depends on the people around you and that having a good, well-oiled network of contacts is important, and you build it correctly, build it strategically, you'll save a massive amount of time and effort.

As soon as you decide to embark on the long journey to a more significant position in society, know this: the further you advance, the easier and more enjoyable the movement forward itself will become. As in any sport, whether running, chess, tennis, or golf—the first steps are never easy and pleasant, but then, with known persistence, you'll definitely catch your second wind.

Another excuse is reference to "lack of talent" for communicating with people. It's unpleasant to watch how your female friend, who chatters non-stop, effortlessly acquires heaps of admirers and sponsors for her business. "Something's wrong with me," immediately flashes through your head. But you're wrong. Believe me, there will always be those around who are smarter, more beautiful, more elegantly dressed, richer, or simply luckier than us. But in reality, such people are quite rare. Most people around are the same as everyone else, including you and me.

When it comes to networking, we create ourselves. One of our first mentors during intelligence training said that "you can't teach someone to be a spy—you can only learn it yourself." It's the same in networking: you acquire experience and skills only in the process. There's no other way.

Frankly speaking, even after many years of operative work, we admit that we're far from the most gifted in creating interpersonal connections. But with acquired experience, we know how to maximize the opportunities given to us by nature, how to listen to those around us to catch what's most important, how to minimize mistakes, and how to motivate ourselves to move forward despite rejections and failures. So you too can learn this.

Is strategic networking ethical? Don't all these strategies introduce something unnatural into human relationships? Doesn't it seem to you that we're manipulating people? If you build relationships with people according to your "secret" plan, don't such relationships become "fake"?

Such an important question cannot be left without attention, so there's no point in postponing it. In any relationship, there are two sides. It's easier to start with yourself. When you really need someone, for example for your business, or if you simply fall in love with someone, your attempt to attract such a person by all reasonable and honest means is not just entirely justified, it's quite natural.

Romeo's nightly serenades under Juliet's window would probably be perceived by our contemporaries as excessively extravagant, but hardly anyone would condemn his romantic impulse. Literature, art, and life itself around us abound with examples of attempts to seduce or win someone over. In the overwhelming number of cases, we have no doubt about their sincerity. Moreover, in movie and book heroes, we admire precisely the persistence with which they seek someone's favor.

And then everything depends on whether this person accepts or rejects you. Regardless of how your acquaintance goes, he or she can always say "no." Perhaps you'll manage somehow to "impose yourself" at the first meeting, but you won't be able to forcibly invade someone else's life. Moreover, the more you insist, the stronger the rejection will be.

Now let's look at networking from the perspective of the object of your interest. When you buy a lottery ticket, you can't be sure that you'll necessarily win. Rather the opposite: you're quite skeptical about winning. However, you would never refuse the prize if you suddenly hit the jackpot. Meeting people is also a kind of lottery. There are people whom you dream of including among your friends, but you don't know how to achieve this. At the same time, you're surrounded by certain individuals whom you don't want to see at all. Attitude toward people depends on what value they represent to you—emotional, aesthetic, material. Perhaps among your friends you'll find several with whom you became acquainted completely by chance. And, thanking fate for such a chance, you don't care too much about how this chance appeared.

Therefore, what matters is not how you establish or develop relationships, but what you bring to these relationships and how you treat the person who's important to you. Networking as a discipline gives you skills for meeting people and developing relationships, but you yourself determine how and why you use these connections in your life.

But what networking definitely does is force you to constantly learn from others. Moreover, within the framework of your strategy, you'll purposefully seek people who know more than you, who are better than you. Thanks to networking, you'll become richer in many senses. Your professional value will grow faster. You'll achieve better mutual understanding with loved ones, with colleagues, and with management. Having become accustomed to thinking strategically, you'll notice problems earlier, avoiding painful conflicts and loss of friends. And we guarantee—you'll become wiser.

# Chapter 1. Networking Tools

As illegal intelligence officers, we performed three tasks simultaneously. Our main task, as should be expected, was gathering intelligence. The second was "work under cover"—well, that is, our "everyday" activity that allowed us to explain our income and interests. The third task consisted of creating a network of contacts and strengthening social status—constant, often exhausting, ascent from the bottom of society to its peaks. In fact, all our visible free time—walks, holidays, sports activities—had to somehow fit into this third task. Such work never stopped and required enormous effort and time, but without it we would have been useless as spies.

Every profession has its own toolkit. Whether you're repairing household plumbing, designing collectible clothing, or teaching economics at a university, you rely on specific knowledge, skills, and equipment without which desired results cannot be achieved. Mastering such skills and bringing them to perfection usually requires years. Certain professions require special abilities from a person, such as musical ear or abstract thinking. It's important to note that each profession forms a certain way of thinking and method that's just as inseparable from the profession as its working tools.

Spies, who hone their operative art over a long time, develop a special memory for people and relationships. Just as an artist can reproduce in detail a previously seen landscape, and a pianist can play several symphonies without looking at the notes, an experienced professional operative is capable of storing in memory the details of many people's stories and the particulars of conversations with them over several years.

A spy's main weapon is their connections. And their main quality is the ability to deal with many situations and people, to learn, adapt, predict, endure, change, and achieve their goals. In short, to understand and organize things and people around themselves. Without initiative and an internal sense of direction, a spy would immediately find themselves in an uncontrollable whirlpool of complications and dangers. The mentality of an operative officer, as an organizer and planner of their environment, defines their strategic approach to networking. To practice this strategic approach, see mistakes, and think systemically, we need to understand what networks of contacts are and how they function.

## "There's Nothing More Practical Than a Good Theory..."

When we create a network of people we need around us, we're essentially weaving a social fabric that connects us with the rest of the world. Constant social interactions allow us to protect ourselves, earn money, produce offspring, and advance solutions that affect our society. The connections we create depend on who we are, what we like, what work we do, and with whom we live. We have enemies and friends, bosses and subordinates. Such interactions aren't random. They truly describe and define our life. The bonds that connect us are regulated by laws and customs and are emotionally charged. They're built into the context of our surrounding environment.

We are social beings who survived, developed, and prospered because we learned to work together despite personal differences and preferences. To survive, we accepted rules and hierarchy, accepted the necessity of interdependence that makes us a family, a platoon, a corporation, a country, humanity. Our desires, beliefs, and occupations unite us into various groups—from startups and football teams to Masonic lodges. We cannot live without relying on mutual material and emotional support. Such sets of stable relationships around us are called networks.

Relationships between people can vary greatly in duration, strength, and intensity. They can be short-term or lifelong. They rely on different motivations—from the opportunity to quickly earn money to unshakeable devotion. Many chose terrible death instead of abandoning their friends, or gave everything they had to other people. Our thinking and characters are formed by those we know. And in some cases—for example, for businesspeople or spies—our value consists of those we know. For such people, social, interpersonal connections constitute their working capital—in the most direct sense of the word.

## Types of Personal Networks

Let's start with describing what personal networks are. Several types can be distinguished. They can be formal, such as those defined by various laws and rules or fixed by organizational structure, as, for example, in a military unit. They can be informal—just recall a Friday evening party when you gather with friends somewhere in a cafe to drink and relax awaiting the approaching weekend. In the latter case, there's no subordination, no hierarchy, no rules at all.

Social networks can be not only local or global but also real or virtual. Now, when there's Facebook, VKontakte, LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, various forums and other similar tools, most of us sometimes have even more virtual friends than those we've ever met in person.

Networks can differ in their purpose—for example, work or leisure. A network or part of your network may belong exclusively to you personally or to you as a member of a group—for example, your contacts in a client company managed by your team.

And finally, networks can be active or "dormant." Imagine people with whom you graduated from school many years ago and whom you meet at best once every ten years on the anniversary of your graduation, or your childhood friends in your hometown, to which you visit from time to time...

## Your Network as Your "Reflection"

Your network will in many ways reflect your individuality. It will depend on whether you're a man or a woman. Your network will change with age. For example, ten-year-old girls have more girl acquaintances in their networks than boys, but at 16 everything may turn out to be exactly the opposite.

Developing relationships, we naturally gravitate toward people of one level of prosperity and social position. This is also true regarding age groups, races, and ethnicity. In the intelligence world, it's widely known that the success of Israeli and Chinese special services largely depends on their use of cohesive ethnic communities around the world.

Just a few decades ago, when the world wasn't so interconnected and globalized, the fact of being born in one region and especially in one locality played a large role in strengthening social ties. Now, however, meeting a fellow countryman has no special significance for most people. Much more often we define ourselves by what school or university we attended.

As a rule, the more diverse someone's network of connections from the point of view of types, social position, and nationality of the people you know, the greater value it can potentially bring and the more opportunities it can offer. A diverse network significantly increases your social and career mobility and creates a bank of useful life experience.

Some factors defining the formation of our networks can be considered a given. One of them, for example, is our family background, which, at least up to a certain age, plays a dominant role in our interactions. Another factor is our genes, which control our networking as if from behind the scenes. As in romantic relationships, they determine our preferences without our knowledge. They lead us to people with whom we can become close, although their characters and views may sometimes seem absolute opposites of ours.

However, as our long intelligence career has shown, a much larger number of determining factors of the network is entirely in our power and under our control. They depend on how we see ourselves, what our life goals are, where and what we study, how we earn a living. They depend on our conscious decisions, religious practices, hobbies, interests, and places we choose to live. By managing these factors under our control, we can build new connections and purposefully develop our personal social networks.

## Connection Map

If we want to develop networks, we first need to understand what they are and what they look like. Otherwise, we won't be able to understand what's happening with them and how to fix emerging problems. There are different ways to draw a social network, so we need to agree on some rules. Since each of us has our own imagination, we can draw pictures of the same social network in different ways. When we first tried to depict our networks during our mission, doing so turned out to be difficult. We made several attempts to place all our contacts on a sheet of white paper, but at first everything looked wrong. The realities of our relationships didn't fit into the framework of the scheme we had in mind. Try now to take a sheet of paper and draw a map of your relationships. See for yourself how difficult and unpleasant this will be. For us, the scheme began to acquire some meaning only after the fourth or fifth attempt. That's precisely why we'll offer some recommendations for optimizing and simplifying the process of building a picture of your network.

Let's mentally plunge into the era of Great Geographical Discoveries, into the times of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama. What made those grandiose journeys possible? Somewhere at the end of the 15th century, cartographers invented a coordinate system with which each point on Earth could be precisely plotted on a map. Various maps had been used since ancient times, but they showed only land contours. Maps using a coordinate system accelerated a revolution in navigation. They gave travelers the opportunity to set out for distant, unexplored places without the risk of losing their way. The main thing was that they could see the sun or stars and had with them a few simple navigation instruments and a clock. Similarly, a map of your network will help you not get lost and feel confident in your relationships. This will make your network much more productive.

As an example, let's draw a map of a simple network. Imagine a student from Thailand living in the United States of America who, to somehow supplement her budget, also works somewhere part-time. If we place our student as a point in the center of the map, we should have two sectors on the map representing the country where she currently lives—the United States—and her homeland—Thailand. We can divide these country sectors into work, home, and other corresponding areas. Then we plotted her fellow students and teachers at the university, roommates, work colleagues, and her relatives on the map. In the USA, we'll have only her university, work, and neighbor connections, but no family members. Friends, however, will be in both countries. Step by step, we can make this picture more detailed, more complex. I think you got the idea... The ability to map your environment will help understand some important concepts related to network development.
