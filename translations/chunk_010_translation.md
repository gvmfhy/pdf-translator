## Diagnosing Problems in Relationships

Relationship development doesn't follow a straight line. Any relationships can encounter obstacles. Even with the best intentions, you won't be able to avoid all pitfalls and neutralize all mines. The radar you used for scanning people at the first meeting—the "OIS" sorting principle (Dangerous? Interesting? Difficult?)—should never be turned off. In some cases, relationships will be interrupted by your counterparties; in others you yourself will cease communication due to lack of progress and points of contact. To avoid serious problems, we must act like doctors. We need to honestly diagnose diseases in relationships as they appear. That's why your "virtual GoPro camera" must always be on so you can detect roughness or flaws in communication in time.

One of the warning signals is a change in commitment to relationship development from your connection. This can manifest in attempts to limit interaction by reducing its intensity—multiple rescheduling of meetings, refusal to answer calls or messages. From time to time you hear excuses and promises to get in touch, but overall the same picture persists. Usually we hope that such problems are temporary in nature, but most often this isn't the case. In the absence of any fault on your part, such behavior from the other person means that communication with you isn't their main priority. Instead of allowing the problem to drag on, we suggest directly discussing this issue with your contact. By sincerely asking such a question, you lose nothing, but the answer may reveal an error on your part that you didn't see before. If so, then the problem can be corrected.

Another warning sign is lack of initiative in interaction. At a more advanced stage of relationships, reciprocity can be used as a kind of litmus test. If at the first stage of relationship development some passivity from the partner can be justified, then a situation in which initiative always remains with you and your vis-à-vis shows no desire to call first testifies that something went wrong. In our operative history there was a case we long discussed between ourselves. One of our potentially interesting contacts never showed initiative, and we almost forcibly dragged him to meetings. However, at meetings he was very talkative and full of enthusiasm. He clearly enjoyed such conversations, which stretched for many hours, but then again disappeared without a trace for several weeks. After long debates, we came to the conclusion that the person was simply bored and was using us to somehow entertain himself. We decided not to call him anymore and turned out to be right—he never contacted us again.

If a person who showed no desire to develop relationships suddenly wants to activate them, it's quite likely that you don't know something about them. In the best case, it may turn out they want to "sell" you something. We note that for spies, such sudden interest can't help but cause wariness: there's serious danger that someone directed them to you. In our case, that's exactly how it was...

Besides the two mentioned signs of impending problems in relationships, you must also monitor the level of emotional involvement and growth of mutual openness and trust. If a person, despite all your efforts, doesn't want to open up, there's a probability that your personalities conflict and the person will never take a liking to you. They may seem polite, will even encourage you at every opportunity—but the relationship will reach a dead end. For example, if an American never invites you home, there's no trust there whatsoever. By the way, Europeans may have a valid reason to avoid this: many apartments in old European cities are quite small to comfortably receive guests.

One way to test whether a relationship has a future is to describe some problem that worries you and ask for help. As we mentioned earlier, you need to ask only for what a person can do without allocating much time or resources. The reaction usually shows their true face.

So, it's difficult to judge the "health" of relationships by some individual interaction—pleasant or not so much. Relationships depend on many factors. They can go up or down, or stall in place. Nevertheless, if you carefully monitor dynamics and track warning signs, you'll most likely be able to revive most problematic relationships.

To track relationship dynamics, you can use the table provided below. It as if measures the "atmosphere" of relationships by four key factors—commitment to relationship development and intensity, initiative and reciprocity, emotional involvement, openness and trust. Values can vary from 0 to 3 (0—absence, 3—maximum possible). After each meeting, evaluate the four factors according to your impressions. Looking at the numbers you'll see in the table after several meetings with a person, you can more objectively assess how your relationships are developing.

We advise from time to time—maybe once a month or so—opening a bottle of wine or settling comfortably with a cup of tea and conducting a "debriefing." Analyzing the dynamics of your interactions with other people, ask yourself where exactly your relationships are now, what the problems and opportunities are, and what your "flight plan" should be for the next period. You must try to clearly imagine what exactly is holding back your relationships and what strengthens them. Assess the state of your connections with each of your key contacts: are you comfortable with each other, do you meet mutual expectations? Are these relationships even alive? Ask yourself what needs to be done to fix communication problems, or, if this doesn't work out, whether you should reduce the time you devote to them. If such debriefing is conducted regularly, it will stop taking much time but will bring order and clarity to your head.

**Table: Relationship Dynamics**

For someone who views networking in the context of a conveyor of business opportunities, the question of eliminating problems in relationships becomes a problem of "industrial scale." Just as a military surgeon faced with a large flow of seriously wounded is forced to make a decision about whom he'll operate on first and who, in essence, is doomed to death, a spy, politician, or sales manager must decide which relationships need to be strengthened at any cost and which to abandon.

The decision to consolidate or terminate contact can have consequences for your other connections. Each contact is connected to many others. Tracking all interdependencies and thinking through the consequences of your decisions in advance is hardly possible without visualizing your entire complex set of contacts. And here your network map will be useful again.

We return again to the main idea underlying strategic networking. Communicating with people is probably the most exciting but at the same time the most difficult process in the world. Mistakes and failures are inevitable here. You'll never achieve your goal 100%. But if, using a thoughtful, systematic approach, you achieve even 70%, this will still be significantly better than the maximum 20-30% that can be achieved relying on intuition or luck alone.

# Chapter 6. "Penetration" into Organizations

Economists distinguish microeconomics, which studies enterprise behavior, and macroeconomics, which deals with the functioning of the economy as a whole. Taking such an approach as a basis, we can divide networking, accordingly, into micro- and macro-networking. Micro-networking is focused on developing connections with a specific person, from first contact to close friendship. Macro-networking is about managing connections with an entire organization and strengthening one's position in society. Regardless of who you are—an employee working with a client company, a manager appointed to a new department, or a person planning a career in politics—it's extremely important to become an insider in an organization or raise your own status in the group with which you work.

Organization is a quite broad concept. It encompasses everything from an army unit to a volunteer group for studying foreign languages. In an organization or in any structured group, relationships with one person can't be completely separated from relationships with everyone else. Perhaps it would be an exaggeration to say that an organization acts as one team, but nevertheless it has its own rules of internal interaction that we can't ignore or change.

## "Deciphering" Organizations

The main distinguishing feature in organizations is the degree of hierarchy. In vertical organizations, the degree of hierarchy is absolute—a higher position automatically gives you power over all subordinate employees, and at the same time better access to information that flows predominantly from above. The antipode of a hierarchical organization is "horizontal." In its extreme variant, this is a group without any structure where all members are equal. In reality, the structures of almost all organizations you encounter are mixed, that is, they combine both vertical and horizontal elements.

The complex of relationships in an organization depends on the formal and informal power of people within it. Formal power consists of the authority given by a person's official position, their relationship to tasks performed by the organization, as well as their place in key organizational processes and access to resources. In turn, informal power is a combination of a person's will and charisma, their competence, external attractiveness, and, to a significant degree, the capabilities of their personal network of contacts.

In an organization we observe the interaction of three different sets of relationships—bureaucratic, power-based, and personal. Bureaucratic relationships reflect official management structures. For example, a person officially occupying the position of department head can issue a bonus or give a reprimand, thereby forcing employees subordinate to them to fulfill certain requirements. Power relationships are only indirectly connected with such formal structures within organizations. They reflect strength of character, experience, personal authority, and social connections—someone's ability to influence other people. Many managers by virtue of their age and experience "radiate" more power than their position gives them. Power relationships also exist between senior and junior team members formally at the same level. Personal relationships stem from human feelings existing between people in the organization—this is love and respect, hatred and fear, friendship and competition.

Since we're focused on relationships between people, questions of power and management are of decisive importance. It's necessary to understand how organizations actually function, regardless of what's written in their official documents. That's precisely why we must distinguish formal and real power structures written on paper and real decision-making processes. Formal management structures often don't reflect the real distribution of power within organizations, whether global business corporations or local charitable foundations. For example, a charitable organization may be led by the spouse of a business magnate formally occupying the position of deputy director for event organization, while its official head, a former minister, appears in public only a couple of times a year.

It's impossible to work effectively with any organization without understanding its real power dynamics. You'll simply give people the opportunity to throw dust in your eyes. The essence of our advice is as follows: assume nothing about the power structure in an organization and consider it a "black box" until you carefully study it.

Against the backdrop of formal structures in organizations, power groups tacitly exist that compete among themselves for the right to make decisions and control resources—personnel policy and budgets. Their strength rests on networks of personal connections of group members and the influence of their leaders, as well as on the ability of such a group to unite against others, master information and resources, and maximally use their personal relationships.

It's important to note that power in organizations belongs to groups, not individuals. It's the trust of group members in each other and their collective control over the organization's vital activity that ensure preservation of their common power. If a person tries to control an organization alone, even being at its very top, they're constantly at risk. The fact is that a group of subordinates can unite to limit the power of an "arrogant" boss and at the same time win more control for themselves. Most often the boss either tries to act on the principle of "divide and rule," setting groups of subordinates against each other, or personally heads the dominant group.

## How to Draw an Organization Map

Having an organization map will be a lifesaver for you, and you won't drown in the complexity of its power dynamics. Such a map will differ greatly from its formal organizational chart because, in addition to functional structure, it will also reflect real power relationships. Its basic graphic elements—people and connections—will be analogous to those used in your personal contact network map, however, special emphasis should be placed on depicting functional and power groups.

Due to the internal complexity of most enterprises and political organizations, representing them as two-dimensional graphs isn't easy. Any picture we draw will be only a rough approximation of the multidimensional relationships that exist in reality. As with your personal contact network, an acceptable picture of the organization will appear not immediately but only after several unsuccessful attempts to capture and simplify it. Don't despair—without such a picture, understanding what's happening is even harder! So, let's, as before, follow this process step by step.

**Stage 1**

In the center of a white sheet of paper, draw a small circle. It will represent the center of power in the organization. Later you'll place several dots or small circles in it representing people who make key decisions. Sometimes it may seem there's only one person who dominates the organization and "deserves" a place in the center circle. Well, so be it. Around the central circle, draw another—with a larger radius. It will be filled with other, less important "bigwigs." After this, you can draw a final outer circle that outlines the outer boundaries or organization in which all other people will be located.

**Stage 2**

From the central point of your drawing, draw lines to the outer circle that will divide the organization into key sectors—business units or functional divisions such as finance department, marketing department, research and development department. Each of the sectors, in turn, can also be divided into component parts.

**Stage 3**

Using dots or small circles, designate key figures in the organization according to their positions and functions. For example, the head of the finance department will be placed in the finance sector, but according to their real capabilities, they may or may not fall into the central circle of "bigwigs." Once you place all key figures on the map, connect them with lines or arrows representing the direction, quality, and intensity of their relationships, just as on your personal contact map.

**Stage 4**

And finally, as a last but certainly no less important step, it's necessary to identify competing power groups in the organization. Such often semi-secret alliances can, at least partially, be discerned after careful analysis of relationships between key decision-makers. Their closeness is hinted at not by direction or intensity but rather by the quality of relationships. The most reliable information about who's on whose team will come from your sources who themselves are insiders in the company. To designate people's belonging to various power groups, color them with different colors or circle these groups with colored lines.

Once you have a map, use it to prepare your strategy. As with personal networks, find out which of your contacts are close to the real "bigwigs," who can become your "connectors," sources of information, "gatekeepers," and "bridges."

## How to Pave a Path into an Organization

If even in relationships with an individual person a thoughtful, strategic approach is important, then when it comes to such complex nodes of human interconnections as organizations, here it plays a key role. You must ask yourself what you want from this or that organization or company and who can give you what you desire. Do you want to become an exclusive supplier? Do you want to be hired for a job? Do you want ultimately a strategic alliance with your business? Or maybe you want the organization to contribute to your charitable foundation?

Our goal: to offer you recommendations that will help build necessary relationships in the organization with fewer mistakes. They may seem intuitively clear, but their proper implementation will require some experience and persistence. And here creating a network map that shows who's who in the organization will help you thoughtfully plan your approach. As you progress, the map will help preserve your deeper knowledge about key "connection nodes" and power centers so that later you can pave paths to the right people.

Using already familiar networking terms, you'll most likely enter the organization through a "bridge," that is, a person you met at some conference or through a friend of a friend. However, the primary and very urgent task is to, regardless of the first, find another, additional "bridge" into the company. It's known that not all relationships will work as intended. It's possible that relationships with the person who brought you here will also be interrupted and this imaginary "door" will close. Moreover, it's quite likely that this person will want to control your relationships with their organization or even extract some benefit from this. If you build stronger relationships with someone else, they'll most likely react with envy and displeasure. After all, for them all other employees in this organization are—in a certain sense—competitors.

Obviously, to acquire an additional "bridge," you'll need time. At first you simply don't have sufficient information about the organization. That's why the second most important task is to use the initial contact to get to "capacitors." That is, to real insiders who know how the organization functions and how real power is distributed. We hope these people will be able to provide you with enough information to help avoid involvement in conflicts of various competing groups. If you're taken as a tool of one of them, this will greatly limit your future opportunities...
